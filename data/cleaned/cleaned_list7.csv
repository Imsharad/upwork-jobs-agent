Job Title:

🚀 Expert in AI System Architecture & Technical Diagramming (Figma, Lucidchart, Miro, draw.io)

Job Description:

We are seeking an experienced AI systems architect and technical diagramming expert to create a high-level system architecture diagram for an AI-Native Government Framework. The goal is to represent how AI-driven decision-making, federated governance, security, and AI compute infrastructure interact within a public sector AI ecosystem.

The final deliverable should be an editable, collaborative, and detailed system architecture diagram, enabling government stakeholders to visualize AI workflows, security enforcement, and AI orchestration layers.

Key Responsibilities:

✅ Translate complex AI architecture into a clear, structured visual representation.
✅ Use collaborative design tools (Figma, Lucidchart, Miro, draw.io) for easy team feedback & revisions.
✅ Ensure the diagram is editable, interactive, and allows for iterative updates.
✅ Apply industry best practices in AI governance, security, and decision orchestration.
✅ Work closely with us to refine the design for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.


---

🌍 Preferred Tools for Delivery:

You must deliver the final diagram in one of the following tools, ensuring that team members can collaborate, comment, and revise as needed:
✅ Figma (Preferred – allows real-time collaboration & structured UI)
✅ Lucidchart (Ideal for structured technical diagrams & flowcharts)
✅ Miro (Best for brainstorming & big-picture design)
✅ draw.io (diagrams.net) (Lightweight, integrates with Google Drive)

📌 Final deliverable must be editable and shareable for ongoing team collaboration.


---

🔹 Diagram Structure & Layered Approach

The diagram should be structured as a hierarchical AI governance framework, organized into four main layers:

1️⃣ User Interaction Layer (Top Layer)

📍 Represents citizens, agencies, and data providers interacting with AI services.

✅ Elements:

Citizens → Request AI-driven government services.

Government Agencies → Manage AI-driven decision-making.

Data Providers → Supply external data via Data Mesh (Decentralized Governance).


📡 Connections:

Citizens → Government Agencies

Government Agencies ↔ Data Providers (via Data Mesh)



---

2️⃣ AI Orchestration & Decision-Making Layer

📍 The core AI processing layer, handling secure, explainable AI decision-making.

✅ Elements:

Prompt Security (IBM Guardrails) – Prevents adversarial AI input.

Multi-Model Competitive Reasoning (MMCR) – AI decisions validated across multiple models.

AI Model Farm – Mix of open-source (Llama 3, Falcon, etc.) & closed-source AI models (if hybrid).

vAI Logging (Verifiable AI Logging) – Ensures AI decision transparency & auditing.

AI Explainability Dashboards – Provides human oversight of AI-generated recommendations.

Sparse Activation & PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) – Optimizes AI execution dynamically.


📡 Connections:

Government Agencies → Prompt Security

Prompt Security → MMCR

MMCR → AI Model Farm (Llama 3, Mixtral-8x22B, Falcon, etc.)

AI Model Farm → vAI Logging → AI Explainability Dashboards

MMCR → Final AI-powered decision → Government Agencies



---

3️⃣ Data Governance & Security Layer

📍 Ensures secure AI usage, compliance, and decentralized AI governance.

✅ Elements:

Data Mesh (Decentralized Governance) – Prevents excessive centralization.

Federated AI Access Control (FAAC) – Role-based AI access & security enforcement.

Dedicated Key Management System (KMS) – Cryptographic trust & encryption management.

Confidential AI Enclaves (Intel SGX, AMD SEV) – Secure processing of sensitive AI workloads.

Selective FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) – Enables encrypted AI model execution.


📡 Connections:

Data Providers → Data Mesh

Data Mesh → FAAC → AI Orchestration Layer

Data Mesh → Confidential AI Enclaves (for sensitive data)

Data Mesh → Selective FHE (for high-sensitivity data processing)



---

4️⃣ AI Compute Infrastructure Layer (Bottom Layer)

📍 Provides the physical AI processing backbone (inference, model training, orchestration).

✅ Elements:

DGX Pods / TPU Clusters – AI compute clusters for on-prem AI processing.

Kafka + Ray Serve – AI event processing framework.


📡 Connections:

DGX Pods / TPU Clusters → AI Model Farm

Kafka + Ray Serve → Multi-Model Competitive Reasoning (MMCR)

AI Explainability Dashboards → Connects to AI decisions for transparency



---

🔹 Design Considerations & Formatting Guidelines

✅ Data Mesh Representation:

Use multiple “Data Provider” nodes connected to a central “Data Mesh” component.


✅ AI Competitive Reasoning Representation:

Show parallel AI decision paths validating each AI response.

Highlight voting/consensus mechanisms preventing single-model bias.


✅ Security & Encryption Representation:

Label where FHE encryption & Confidential AI Enclaves are used.

Use icons for AI security features (guardrails, key management, etc.).


✅ Sparse Activation & PEFT Representation:

Add callout boxes near AI Model Farm explaining optimization techniques.


✅ Arrow & Flow Representation:

Solid arrows for data flow.

Dashed arrows for security, governance, and AI decision validation.


✅ Color Coding for Readability:

🔴 Security components (Guardrails, FAAC, Key Management).

🔵 AI Decision-Making (MMCR, AI Model Farm, Sparse Activation).

🟢 Governance & Explainability (Data Mesh, vAI Logging, Dashboards).

⚫ Compute Infrastructure (DGX Pods, Kafka, Ray Serve).


✅ Legend:

Include a simple key explaining colors, arrow types, and decision paths.

We are seeking a skilled Facebook tracking expert to implement more accurate tracking for our teeth whitening service.

My business is essentially a lead gen business as we run ads to book in clients for our teeth whitening service, but currently the conversions (booking) that we receive in the facebook ads manager are not lining up with the bookings that we are getting in reality.

We have a """"Thank You"""" page that clients are automatically redirected to after filling in their details, and that page is being tracked by a Google Tag.

My main concern is the inaccuracies I have been noticing within my facebook ads manager. The volume of inbound leads we get is not super high, so its easy to spot when things are not lining up, for example there will be days where facebook tracks a bunch of leads, but in reality when I cross check it to my bookings (I have a """"How did you hear about us"""" question) no one even came from facebook or Instagram. 

I am aware of softwares like HYROS and Triplewhale and would like to explore options to implement similar code to these softwares to gain more accurate data within the ads manager if possible

I am currently capturing the FBCLID into a simple CRM along with my clients phone numbers.

Your primary responsibility will be to analyze our existing configuration and implement necessary adjustments to ensure 100% accuracy in tracking our campaigns and user interactions.
