The VAPI inbound voice agent is functional for inbound calls, but there are issues with its conversational flow and pronunciation that need to be addressed to ensure a seamless user experience.

The agent's primary function is to greet callers and ask whether they are calling about buying, selling, or rentals. It then checks if the caller is looking for a specific person. If a name is mentioned, the AI responds with, “Sorry, [name] is unavailable right now. Can I take some details and have them return your call?”. It then takes the callers details and passes it on for a real human to follow up and call back.

Currently, the AI is experiencing problems with mispronouncing street names and getting stuck in loops. For example, after asking for the caller’s details, it might unexpectedly restart the script and reintroduce itself. In some cases, it also becomes confused when the caller responds with “Yes” to a question like “Can I take some details?” and fails to progress properly through the interaction.

The AI is already built, so I’m looking for someone with expertise in VAPI prompting and conversational AI to refine the existing prompt and resolve these issues. This should be a straightforward and quick job for the right expert.

Following the completion of this job, I would also like to hire you to help me fix an outbound calling prompt that is experiencing similar issues with following a script."	3 hours ago	Hourly	Intermediate	Est.

With so many “experts” out there, it’s hard to know who to trust. Our platform verifies health claims from popular influencers using credible scientific research. The end goal is simple: make it easier for people to find honest, evidence-based guidance.

What’s In It for You?
- A chance to work on a meaningful project that helps bring clarity and credibility to online health information.
- An opportunity to apply your data integration, content parsing, and verification logic skills in a practical scenario.
- Showcase your ability to connect API’s (perplexity/ChatGPT) in a cohesive, impactful dashboard.

Overview:
You’ll create an admin panel that automatically:
- Finds and Analyzes Content from health influencers (suggestion to use Perplexity API - open to other ideas).
Identifies Health Claims hidden in that content. 
- Checks Those Claims against trusted scientific journals. (Example: consensus.app, perplexity.ai or OpenAI)
- Displays the Results in a clean, user-friendly interface — similar to our provided mockups.
High-Level Requirements:
Influencer Discovery:
Pull recent health-related tweets and podcast transcripts for a given influencer.
Please build a workflow for taking a health influencers claims into a series of health claims
Find an ai logic to remove duplicate claims (e.g., the same fact stated in multiple posts).
Claim Verification:
Spot health claims and categorise them (e.g., Nutrition, Medicine, Mental Health).
Cross-reference these claims against reliable journals.
Determine a verification status (Verified, Questionable, Debunked) and assign a trust score (just use AI to make up a scoring system).
Dashboard Display:
Create a leaderboard showing influencers, their trust scores, follower counts, and claim stats.
Have an influencer detail page listing all claims, their verification status, and confidence scores.
Include a research configuration page where you can pick date ranges, the number of claims to analyze, and which journals to use.
Time:
This should take about 5-8 hours of focused development time.
Tools:
As recommended we suggest Perplexity API. If your output you can allow for the user to input their own API keys to test the outputs. 

What We Provide:
Example screenshots of a front-end dashboard to guide your UI layout and data presentation.
Freedom to use any tools and technologies you’re comfortable with.
What We’d Love to See:
A functional demo where we can input an influencer’s name, run the “research,” and see results.
A well thought out logic flow on how to handle the AI logic to search for the right information.
Reflections on best tools to use throughout this process.
Uploaded to Netlify/Vercel or any other platform ready to be tested
Ready to Bring Clarity to the World of Online Health Advice?
This is your chance to tackle a real-world problem. You’ll be instrumental in helping people find reliable information amidst the noise. If this sounds like a challenge you’re excited to take on, we’d love to have your expertise. Let’s make online health content more trustworthy together!

"Hello!  I am looking for a single person with extensive development experience to partner with me in building a web and mobile app that helps home service businesses (think HVAC, plumbing, etc) to analyze the results from their marketing agencies/partners.  

I have fifteen years of experience in digital marketing and web development, and am looking to build an app that will leverage my knowledge to help small businesses avoid being taken advantage of by their marketing agencies.  The app will start in the home services industry, but may be opened up to additional niches in the future. 

I cannot say in detail the specific of the apps for privacy reasons, but I can tell you these things for now:
1. All in all, this will not be that challenging to build.  It is mostly API integrations and displaying data with charts and graphs, then sending notifications if/when certain thresholds are met.  Some notifications would be sent out if certain events happened, as evidenced by the data. 
2. The primary challenge will be building the onboarding/setup paths in order to enable non-technical business owners to easily use the app. I do think we can have human-assisted onboarding at the outset, but we will need to obsess over the necessary simplicity of onboarding as a first priority. 
3. The app will connect with a host of marketing-related APIs such as WordPress, Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Google Business Profile, Google Ads, Facebook Insights, and a variety of others.  
4. We will be using a number of other APis for non-marketing-data related uses, such as to pull demographic data about zip codes, or to leverage OpenAI’s APIs for AI enhancement of some features. 
5. The app will first be a web app, heavily designed for mobile, but must be built to turn it into a beautiful native mobile app after launch.  

I am hoping to boot strap this product out of my own pocket, which means two things:
1. First, I am looking for someone who is willing to accept a fair, but perhaps lower-end hourly rate to build the app with me, with some compensation coming from either legal equity or legal profits sharing from the business.  We can discuss this in depth at a later hiring stage, but I am truly looking for a partner here. 
2. Second, you must use Replit to build the product in order to dramatically increase your coding speed.  I suppose I am open to another app like Replit, but I am pretty heavily “married” to using Replit…it’s great. 

Basic professional requirements
1. Must have at least three years experience in software or web development. 
2. Must be willing to have at least 2 hours overlap with me during the day (I am CST).  Prefer those who work 8-5 CST with me, but I am wiling to be flexible on the schedule. 
3. Must speak near native English to ensure smooth communication.  

There is probably more, but this should be enough to get us started.  As you can see from my profile, I have en extensive history on Upwork and am excited to find a partner for this venture.  

To apply, please DO NOT USE CHATGPT for your cover letter.  Be a human, please.:). And, please tell me your thoughts on my proposal, as well as your expected hourly rate to join with me on this journey.  

This is a fantastic opportunity for the right person, and I am looking forward to meeting you! - Brad"	4 hours ago	Hourly	Intermediate	Est. Time:	30+ hrs/week	['Web Application', 'Full-Stack Development', 'API Integration', 'AI Model Integration', 'Replit']
