Overview:
We are developing a suite of embedded live, dynamic Tableau-based dashboards and reports for a specific industry and for a vertically-diverse audience (from end-users to senior leadership). 

On the team, we have deep expertise with Tableau, data modelling, and project management, but we are missing someone who can bridge the gap between raw data and a compelling, intuitive user experience.

This role is someone who is part management consultant (for narrative structure), and part product/UX designer (for wireframing, visuals, and user flow). Naturally, someone with Tableau and Figma experience will be an asset, with a focus on the latter vs. the former (as existing Tableau resource will maintain ownership).

Arguably, Figma is not needed - and a consultant with extremely strong memo- and presentation-building skills could be successful as well, but our suite of dashboards and reports are numerous in number, with various workbooks and multiple tabs each - all must be coherently stitched together into a compelling story.

Key Activities:
- Work with stakeholders to understand core business questions, but those questions and any underlying assumptions should be challenged
- Create low-fidelity wireframes and user flows (Tableau dashboards and reports have deep drill-down capabilities on data and multiple levels of workbooks and tabs: all of which have to be cohesively brought together)
- Work with our Tableau Developer and Project Manager to translate wireframes into requirements and Jira-type tasks
- Establish design guidelines, colour schemes, and placement of filters/charts
- Ideally leverage a Figma-Tableau extension to load a Tableau skeleton onto Figma, wireframe and design, then send Tableau file back to Tableau developer so that Figma-established design standards are flowed through

Key Skills:
- Experience at a consulting firm or similar role where you've had to pitch narratives, distilled complex data into crisp, impactful visuals
- UI/UX or Product Design: Proficient in Figma, with strong grasp of layout design, colour theory, and user flows.
- Comfort with Tableau, enough to collaborate with existing Tableau leadership on the team
- Bonus: experience with real estate property metrics

We need a full-funnel expert who can map video-driven marketing motions from first touch to last touch, integrating both organic and paid strategies. This expert should also recommend what we’re missing, like landing pages, nurture sequences, or additional touchpoints, and help optimize our existing tech stack for tracking engagement and attribution.

This role is for a strategist, not just a media buyer. We need someone who can visualize the entire marketing workflow and make sure video is being used effectively at every stage of the funnel.

✅ Optimize ad spend & retargeting – Use platforms like LinkedIn Ads, YouTube Ads, 6sense, Warmly, and Clay to drive conversions
✅ Identify gaps in our strategy – Recommend solutions (e.g., landing pages, nurture sequences) that complement our video-first approach
✅ Refine and document best practices – Develop playbooks for repeatable, scalable video distribution strategies
✅ Advise on MarTech stack – Guide tool selection and integration for better engagement tracking & analytics

Who You Are:

🎯 B2B marketing strategist with 5+ years of experience, preferably in cybersecurity or SaaS
📊 Proven track record optimizing video marketing funnels & reducing CAC
📈 Deep understanding of demand gen, ABM, and attribution models

I need two quick needs on HubSpot, some automations (including various combinations of Zapier / Apollo / ChatGPT pro API / and etc), and then probably more on an ongoing basis.

Immediate quick fixes:

1- I embed HubSpot forms in my Wordpress website, but the font size in the forms is too small. I'd like it to match the page: 

https://www.trianagroup.com/industrial-panelist-onboarding

2- LinkedIn data enrichment: 

    - When people share their LinkedIn profile, I'd like to enrich their HubSpot with content from their LinkedIn profile: job title, company, and from there I'd like to get the company's website domain URL. 

3- One of the next projects would be resume parsing: 

I collect people's resumes in a property called """"resume copy-paste"""" (it's a text property where they paste their resume as an unformatted text): 

     - When I can't enrich a profile using the LinkedIn link, I'd like to extract the job title and most recent employer from the """"resume copy-paste"""" field. 

    - Then, I'd like to push that information to the corresponding properties in HubSpot (when it's missing). 

     - I'd like to automate the search of the company's domain name, using just the company name and any context that can be found in the resume (if it's not found via the LinkedIn profile).

NB: I have the following tools currently: 
 * Zapier account 
 * OpenAI account with access to their API
 * Apollo.io (with a lot of credits)
 * Sales Navigator Pro

Idea Generation
Content Production
Social Media Posting & Feedback

The system must ensure smooth movement of content through each phase, track performance, and keep an organized Content Inventory with content history and related data, all while integrating with Slack and Google Drive.

🔹 Workflow Overview
1️⃣ Phase-Based Workflow Structure
Each piece of content follows a structured pipeline:
Phase 1: Idea Generation

Team submits new content ideas via Slack bot or directly into the system.
Kanban View: """"To-Do → In Progress → Ready for Approval""""
Once an idea is approved, it automatically moves to the Content Production phase.
Phase 2: Content Production

Approved ideas appear in the To-Do list for the Content Production team.
Each idea must go through the following steps:

Briefing & Assigning → Content Creation → Editing & Review → Approval
Kanban View: """"To-Do → In Progress → Review → Done""""
Once content is finalized and approved, it moves to the Social Media phase.

Phase 3: Social Media Posting & Feedback
Finalized content appears in the Marketing Team’s To-Do list.
The team posts the content on the designated social media platforms.
Kanban View: """"To Post → Posted → Feedback Needed → Done""""
After posting, the team submits performance feedback (2-3 days later).

🔹 Content Inventory & Tracking
The Content Inventory is the central repository for all content. It contains:
Content ID (unique for each piece)
Google Drive Link to the content file (no internal storage needed)
Posting History: Where and when it was posted (tracked by Slack bot)
Performance Feedback: Notes from the Social Media team

🔍 Inventory Structure
Pending Orders Section: Displays all content currently in progress across different phases, showing a percentage of pipeline completion.
Filter & Navigate: Easily navigate to the relevant phase in the pipeline by clicking on the Content ID.

🔹 Automation & Slack Integration (maybe?)
Idea Submission: Team submits ideas via a Slack bot, which are automatically added to the Idea Generation phase. Content Posting Tracking:

Once content is posted, the Social Media team fills out a Slack form specifying:
Content IDs used
Where it was posted (platform & username)
The system updates the Content Inventory with posting history.

Feedback Submission: After 2-3 days, the Social Media team adds feedback on performance, which is linked back to the Content Inventory.

🔹 No-Code Platform Requirements
The no-code expert must recommend and implement tools that:
Support Kanban-based workflows for each phase
Integrate with Slack for automation & notifications
Link to Google Drive for content access
Track posting history and feedback in a centralized inventory
Enable navigation between inventory and pipeline phases

🔹 Next Steps for No-Code Expert
Review Workflow Requirements: Ensure the platform can manage multi-phase pipelines and integrate seamlessly with Slack and Google Drive.
Recommend Tools & Architecture: Provide platform suggestions with pros/cons for each based on our needs.
Develop the Content CRM: Build the system, focusing first on internal team workflows and later on the Creator Dashboard.

🚀 Goal
To create a scalable Content CRM that will streamline content production, track performance, and ensure seamless collaboration, all while minimizing development time and costs using no-code tools","2 days ago","2040.0","Expert","Est. Time:","0.0","","31.0"

This system will be used internally by our company to consolidate and enhance data from multiple sources—ultimately providing a high-quality, unified metadata repository.

*Key Objective:*
* Develop an AI-driven metadata engine (knowledge graph, LLM/NLP workflows, data integration pipelines, etc.).
* Integrate with multiple data sources, merge and clean metadata, and expose it to our internal applications via robust APIs.

So we are going to pull in movie data (movie metadata) from multiple sources like tmdb, TheTVDB, watchmode etc.
First, you have to design a unified database schema to store these movie data from above different sources. 
This data will be cleaned up by removing duplicates and going through different kinds of cleaning processes, and finally used to build a centralized database for the company.
And the database should be connected to internal applications of the company like a calendar. For example, if there is a new movie and it is added to the database, it should be reflected in the calendar so that the user knows what movies are coming up. I think this can be done using OpenAI's function calling.
All of the above should be done through AI agents.

*So you have to be highly skilled at following areas:*
* Langchain, LangGraph, Knowledge graph, GraphRAG, OpenAI's function calling, AI agents developing
•  tmdb, TheTVDB, watchmode API
* Database schema design and data pipeline and cleaning process
* API documentation
* AWS

We are seeking a skilled Facebook tracking expert to implement more accurate tracking for our teeth whitening service.

My business is essentially a lead gen business as we run ads to book in clients for our teeth whitening service, but currently the conversions (booking) that we receive in the facebook ads manager are not lining up with the bookings that we are getting in reality.

We have a """"Thank You"""" page that clients are automatically redirected to after filling in their details, and that page is being tracked by a Google Tag.

My main concern is the inaccuracies I have been noticing within my facebook ads manager. The volume of inbound leads we get is not super high, so its easy to spot when things are not lining up, for example there will be days where facebook tracks a bunch of leads, but in reality when I cross check it to my bookings (I have a """"How did you hear about us"""" question) no one even came from facebook or Instagram. 

I am aware of softwares like HYROS and Triplewhale and would like to explore options to implement similar code to these softwares to gain more accurate data within the ads manager if possible

I am currently capturing the FBCLID into a simple CRM along with my clients phone numbers.

Your primary responsibility will be to analyze our existing configuration and implement necessary adjustments to ensure 100% accuracy in tracking our campaigns and user interactions. 

Please do not apply if you haven't done this exact job before as I do not want to waste any time.

Since GPT Vision is somewhat lacking in it's capabilities, there should be a secondary (or even third, if there is a noticeable improvement) AI image interpretation API which would validate what GPT Vision sees, or disputes it. This is why a third LLM would be good, so there should usually be 2 out of 3 of them that agree on things, which should increase the accuracy of the final output.

I would like an image returned to the user if they request it, which is the same as their screenshot, but with a certain area highlighted or circled so they know exactly where to look.  This way, the user can ask something like """"Where do I click in order to submit this form"""" and it would send them back their same screenshot with the """"Submit"""" button circled or highlighted.  Or """"Where is the part of this code which is giving me an error?"""".

If the user sees an error in the AI suggestions, there should be an ability to submit the error noticed, along with the corresponding screenshot.  This information can be used later to further train the AI to better understand these same tasks in the future.  There should also be an ability to train the AI model further on the back end so that it can learn from new pictures (screenshots) and descriptions of them.

All conversations with the bot would be saved in the extension.  Specific conversations could be easily found using a search feature.  They would ideally be able to be organized and exported as well.

The project should be user-friendly and have seamless, low latency integration with GPT and any other APIs. The user will have the ability to send screenshots to the extension by just pressing one of the """"F"""" keys while the extension is open/live.  Alternatively, they can hold the same (or other) """"F"""" key while selecting a square on their screen with their mouse, in order to capture a smaller, more specific area for the app to analyze it better.

It should also have another layer of OCR integrated on top of what GPT """"sees"""", to validate any text picked up in the picture.

The extension should have certain websites it will not allow such as streaming services, online courses, financial/banking sites, confidential corporate (or other sensitive) material.  As a secondary safety feature, the app should pre-process all screenshots locally first to ensure any private data doesn't leave their own computer.  This would also act as another failsafe measure to restrict access to these sites from the user, so that the program doesn't violate any restrictions.

🚀 Goal: Fully automate cold calling operations using Vapi AI to handle 500 calls daily, converting cold leads into scheduled meetings with minimal human intervention.
________________________________________
1. System Architecture
Core Components
✅ Lead Database: Google Sheets (Stores business names, phone numbers, emails, call status, and scheduling details).
✅ AI Cold Calling: Vapi AI (Handles outbound calls, manages objections, and books meetings).
✅ Automation Layer: n8n (Connects all tools and automates workflow).
✅ Scheduling & Calendar Management: Google Calendar (Meetings are auto-booked when leads agree to a call).
✅ Singapore-Specific Setup: Adjustments for visibility restrictions (workaround for local call regulations).
✅ Email Follow-ups: Gmail (Automated meeting confirmations and follow-ups).
✅ Developer’s Responsibility: Ensuring seamless connectivity to minimize issues such as calls being blocked, flagged as spam, or delivery failures.
________________________________________
2. Workflow Overview (500 Calls/Day)
Step-by-Step Process
1️⃣ Lead Input & Targeting
•	Lead data (business name, phone, email) is manually or automatically added to Google Sheets.
•	Target businesses are based in Singapore.
2️⃣ Trigger AI Calls (500 Calls Daily)
•	n8n pulls 500 leads daily from Google Sheets and sends them to Vapi AI for calls.
•	Vapi AI follows pre-defined call scripts optimized for conversion.
3️⃣ Handling Scenarios in Vapi AI
•	If the lead is interested → AI books a meeting in Google Calendar.
•	If the lead has objections → AI follows a pre-programmed objection-handling script.
•	If the lead requests a callback → Vapi AI schedules a follow-up call.
•	If the lead does not answer → AI reschedules automatically for another attempt.
•	If the lead declines → Status is updated in Google Sheets, removing them from future attempts.
4️⃣ Meeting Scheduling & Confirmation
•	If a meeting is booked, n8n:
o	Updates Google Sheets (Status: """"Meeting Scheduled"""").
o	Creates a Google Calendar event.
o	Sends a confirmation email via Gmail.
5️⃣ Post-Call Processing & Follow-Ups
•	Leads that do not answer are retried within 24 hours.
•	Leads who request more info are sent an automated follow-up email via Gmail.
•	Meeting confirmations are sent automatically to both parties.
________________________________________
3. Technical Parameters & API Integrations
Component	Technology	Purpose
Lead Storage	Google Sheets	Stores leads, call logs, status updates
AI Voice Agent	Vapi AI	AI-powered call execution, objection handling, scheduling
Automation	n8n	Connects Sheets, Vapi, Calendar for real-time updates
Scheduling	Google Calendar	Auto-books and tracks meetings
Follow-up Emails	Gmail	Sends automated confirmation & follow-ups
Logging & Tracking	Google Sheets	Updates lead status post-call
Anti-Spam Prevention	Developer Implementation	Minimizes call blocking & spam flags
________________________________________
4. Deployment Considerations
📌 Singapore-Specific Adjustments
🔹 Call Visibility: Many Singapore users have their numbers hidden from unknown calls. Vapi AI must optimize call retry logic for better reach.
🔹 Call Timing Optimization: Calls should be made during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM SG Time) to maximize answer rates.
🔹 Compliance & Local Regulations: Ensure Do Not Call (DNC) list compliance to avoid issues.
📌 AI Voice Agent Tuning (Vapi AI)
•	Call Script Optimization:
o	AI handles basic objections (e.g., “I’m busy,” “Not interested right now,” “Send me details”).
o	Closing strategy: AI secures the meeting before ending the call.
•	Call Volume Management:
o	Calls are spaced out to prevent spam detection.
o	AI retries unanswered calls at different times of the day.
•	Developer Responsibility for Spam Prevention:
o	Setting up rotating phone numbers to avoid getting flagged.
o	Implementing AI-driven call pacing to reduce high-frequency call flags.
o	Adjusting speech patterns in Vapi AI to prevent detection as a bot.
________________________________________
5. Success Metrics & Next Steps
📈 Key Metrics:
•	Call Success Rate: 35% of calls answered and completed.
•	Meeting Booking Rate: 4% of leads converted to meetings.","2 days ago","0.0","Intermediate","Est. Time:","0.0","","27.0"
