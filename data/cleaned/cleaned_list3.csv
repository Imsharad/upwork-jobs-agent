I use this code from cookbook: https://github.com/phidatahq/phidata/tree/main/cookbook/memory

I need 2 modifications:

1. I want to implement the website as the knowledge base for these agents, we'll have URLs(around 1,000)

https://docs.phidata.com/knowledge/website

I tested it with 1 website, it works fine, but I need a solution that will save these 1000 urls to our database, so each user can use it as their knowledge base


2. Reducing the duration time for the agent's response.

I use all these memory creation function, because I want agent to remember things about the user.

But I am not sure if I'm overdoing it, because agent's average response time is around 11-20 seconds. ((it keeps increasing while agent adds more data to its memory)

My goal is 4-5 seconds which I achieved with other frameworks for memory-based agents.

I check the debug logs, most of the time goes to call the tools. 

I want you to check the phidata documentation to find out if these memories are all necessaries? 

In some forum I found out that, we can use the native python functions to make them run  async & every [x] message instead of the each run, so they won't be taking too much time every message.

So, all you need to do is researching the phidata documentation or ask on the discord etc, to find the answers for these questions and fix them.

My code is ready, I need optimization with these.

I am seeking an experienced AI developer with expertise in Azure OpenAI to guide and train me in building a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) chatbot. The solution will streamline the DPIA process by augmenting users as they navigate forms, analyze existing documents, and collaborate with team members to complete assessments efficiently.

Project Overview:
The DPIA chatbot will:

Assist Users with Navigation and Drafting:

Users, led by a project manager (PM), will upload documentation (e.g., IT specs, business cases, data flow diagrams) into the platform.
The chatbot will analyze the uploaded documents and match key terms to DPIA form questions, suggesting drafts for user input.
Example: For a question like ""Who is the data processor?"" the chatbot will analyze documents and suggest the most relevant answer based on its analysis.
Dual-Bot System for Augmentation:

Central Bot: Assists users by analyzing uploaded documents, drafting DPIA sections, and guiding them through form questions.
Contextual Help Bot: Located on the side panel, this bot explains technical or legal terms and concepts in real-time by referencing the user's documents. For example, it could explain ""data processor"" and identify the most likely candidate from the user's documentation.
Collaborative, Role-Based Workflow:

Users work collaboratively with structured roles:
Admins: Set up users, configure workflows, and assign roles.
Project Manager (PM): Leads the DPIA process and works with team members.
Team Members: Includes legal, technical, and data experts who contribute to specific sections.
DPIA Team: Reviews, validates, and approves the completed form.
The platform facilitates back-and-forth collaboration, allowing PMs to ask clarifying questions directly to team members. For instance, the PM may confirm a data flow with a technical expert or consult a legal advisor on compliance.
Risk Identification and Mitigation:

Once the DPIA team reviews the draft, the chatbot identifies potential risks and suggests mitigation strategies.
These suggestions are sent back to the PM for review and further collaboration with team members, enabling iterative revisions until the form is finalized.
Workflow Management:

Admin functionality to configure roles, assign workflows, and oversee user activity.
Users navigate the DPIA workflow with chatbot assistance until completion.
Completed DPIA forms are routed to the DPIA team for final approval.
Technical Details:

Azure OpenAI Integration:
Utilize GPT-4 APIs, Query My Documents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enable document-informed suggestions and contextual assistance.
Document Analysis:
Build tools to analyze uploaded files and match key terms or insights to DPIA form questions. This ensures consistent, accurate responses throughout the process.
Backend Development:
Can be developed using .NET Core or Python, depending on expertise and suitability.
API development to integrate document analysis, AI-powered drafting, and contextual explanations.
Cloud Hosting on Microsoft Azure:
Leverage the Azure OpenAI Landing Zone Blueprint for a secure, scalable, and compliant cloud infrastructure.
Frontend Features:
User-friendly interface with a Central Bot for guidance and a Contextual Help Bot for explanations.
Workflow tools for collaborative drafting and role-based inputs."	12 hours ago	0.0	Expert	Est. Budget:	0	['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Artificial Intelligence']	10000.0	7.1	True

We sell luxury new homes ranging from $500k to $2 Million. We generate several thousand leads per month from various sources including google advertising, Meta/Facebook leads, Microsoft Ads, and direct website leads. The goal is to convert leads into physical tours of our community, and convert tours into sales of new homes.

For New Leads:
The goal would be for the platform to text new leads with a semi-custom introductory message within 30-90 seconds of the lead entering our system and, if the lead responds, engage in a simple, curated conversation with the ultimate goal of scheduling a phone conversation with a lifestyle consultant or physical tour. The introductory message and responses may be tailored depending on how the lead entered our system (did they download an E-Book, Schedule a Visit, Ask a Question, Request Specific Information, etc)

For existing leads:
On regular intervals, the goal would be for the platform to attempt to re-engage older leads via text during business hours.

For existing leads (who have booked tours):
When a lead has booked a tour of our community, the goal would be for the platform to send an automated text 7 days prior to the tour and 24 hour prior to the tour. In the event the lead responds, the platform would respond in a curated manner.

For all text conversations, we would want the platform to notify a live representative if the conversation is ""going off the rails"" so that a live representative can either step into the texting or make a clarifying call."	18 hours ago	86.0	Expert	Est.

We are looking to build an automated client acquisition funnel for our business. The client acquisition funnel will need to be built for scale deployment with 100,000+ potential clients moving through the funnel each month. Given the volume, maintaining an efficient variable cost structure associated with what tools and platforms are selected to comprise the funnel will be important (i.e. Make.com over Zapier given the cost per operation is more economical). 

The client funnel will need to be comprised of the following:

1. AI chatbot (we have a prompt that is currently working well which we prototyped through Chatbase attached) and the associated knowledge base.

-The chatbot will be deployed within the hero section of a landing page for prospective clients to interact with.

-The chatbot will need to be able to pull from an CRM/excel/googlesheet/some type of database that we have pre-populated to greet their prospective client with a custom greeting and provide the prospect with information based on the name of their business that we already have stored.

2. Chatbot educates the client, answers questions about what we do and our process, and collects required data to prepare an engagement letter for the client to sign. The requisite data is not collected through a form in the chat but extracted from the conversation so the interaction is less bot-like. 

3. Required data is stored in a CRM system (likely Husbpot) along with the text of the client chat.

4. Within the chat once the client has provided their information, an engagement letter is populated with the variables the client just provided for them to sign via electronic signature (we would like to find a cheaper solution than DocuSign given the potential volume).

5. Once the client signs a copy of the engagement letter, a copy of the executed engagement letter is emailed to them, and stored in the CRM system associated with their contact and an email is triggered to them thanking them. 

We would like to start the project immediately and hope this could be completed in 1-2 weeks. 

You will advise on the best funnel tool stack for cost, flexibility and features.

You will work independently but engage directly with me for project management, business decision making etc.
