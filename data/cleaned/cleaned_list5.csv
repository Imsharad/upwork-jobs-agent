Our goal is to develop a Chatbot that allows clients to ask questions in natural language and receive accurate, context-aware responses based on their proprietary data.

Key Requirements:
- Multi-Tenancy & Customer Isolation: The solution must support multi-tenancy, ensuring complete data isolation between different clients.
- Multi-Agent Architecture: The system should integrate multiple agents, with the primary agent serving as the source of truth (e.g., databases, vector stores) and secondary agents pulling data from additional sources such as APIs.
- Scalability & Production Readiness: The architecture must be robust, scalable, and optimized for real-world production environments.

What We’re Looking For:
- An expert with deep knowledge of Chatbot development, RAG frameworks, and natural language processing (NLP).
- Proven experience in designing and implementing multi-tenant, multi-agent systems.
- Familiarity with both SaaS and open-premise solutions, as we are open to either approach.
