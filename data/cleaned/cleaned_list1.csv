Project Overview
We are seeking an experienced freelance developer (or small dev team) to build and launch a robust in-house SMS communication platform. This platform will be the foundation to gradually replace our current use of Ringy. The initial focus will be on SMS blasts, drip campaigns, basic analytics, and contact management. Over time, we plan to expand the platform’s functionality to include advanced marketing features, call routing, and deeper analytics.

Key Responsibilities
1.	Core SMS Functionality
    o	Implement bulk SMS blasting with real-time status tracking (sent, delivered, failed).
    o	Design and develop drip messaging logic (time windows, follow-ups, conditional sending).
    o	Integrate inbound SMS handling and status webhooks from Twilio.

2.	Contact Management & CSV Handling
    o	Develop secure CSV import/export features (including data validation and deduplication).
    o	Create a structured database for contacts (with tagging, segmentation, opt-in status).

3.	User Roles & Permissions
    o	Implement multi-level user access (Admin, Marketing User, Developer Superadmin).
    o	Build out user management, including settings, impersonation, and org-level permissions.

4.	Twilio Integration
    o	Set up Twilio subaccounts, handle phone number provisioning/releasing.
    o	Ensure robust error handling, rate-limit compliance, and usage tracking.
    o	Support MMS (send/receive multimedia messages).

5.	Reporting & Analytics
    o	Provide basic metrics on deliverability, failures, and reply rates.
    o	Establish database schemas for capturing performance data.
    o	(Potential Future) Integrate with external BI tools or build advanced reporting.

6.	Architecture & Tech Stack
    o	Likely a Node.js/Express or similar backend for REST/GraphQL APIs.
    o	Frontend using React, Vue, or Angular for campaign management and analytics dashboards.
    o	Postgres or Supabase for data storage and real-time updates.
    o	Deploy in a scalable environment (AWS, GCP, or similar) with 
 best practices for CI/CD.

7.	Future Expansions
    o	Optional call routing integration (e.g., Twilio Voice).
    o	More sophisticated marketing automation (keyword-based branching, advanced drip logic).
    o	Extended analytics (funnel tracking, conversions, multi-touch attribution).

Why This Project Is Exciting
•	Ownership & Control: You will be architecting a mission-critical system with full creative and technical freedom, rather than patching existing solutions.
•	High Impact: Our marketing teams rely heavily on SMS campaigns. Your work will directly shape how they reach thousands of leads every day.

    o	Strong database design with Postgres or similar relational DB.

2.	Proven Experience
    o	Has built or contributed to large-scale SMS, marketing automation, or CRM-like platforms.
    o	Familiar with best practices for data security, compliance (e.g., handling “STOP” for TCPA), and performance optimization.

3.	Collaboration & Communication
    o	Comfortable working closely with our internal stakeholders: Project Owner, Marketing Director, Developers.
    o	Willing to provide regular updates, demos, and documentation.
    o	Ability to translate business requirements into a clean, maintainable technical design.

4.	Problem-Solving & Adaptability
    o	Able to propose effective solutions when faced with technical constraints or changing requirements.
    o	Resourceful in researching and applying the latest Twilio, SMS, and marketing compliance standards.

Scope & Engagement

Context;

Innovista Group is a Melbourne-based granny flat (small secondary homes or ""backyard homes"") specialist focused on helping Victorian homeowners maximize their property potential through secondary dwellings. 

With recent regulatory changes in Victoria making granny flats more accessible, we've created a comprehensive 5-minute assessment guide to help property owners quickly determine their site's suitability for a granny flat. 

This lead magnet addresses the primary pain point for potential clients - understanding if their property qualifies for a granny flat before investing significant time and resources into the process.

Scope of Works

The project involves implementing a comprehensive lead generation system for our already-designed granny flat guide. All creative assets, including the 5-minute guide, ad designs, and marketing copy, have been completed internally through Canva. The primary focus is on technical implementation and infrastructure setup, including:

- PDF hosting and analytics tracking (we have onedrive & google drive - but open to suggestions on better 3rd party hosting solutions specific to lead magnets if need be for better tracking / analytics)
- CRM integration with HubSpot (including creating the funnels / submission forms attached to the meta & google ads)
- Meta and Google Ads campaign setup. Meta ads x 2 (one will be an image ad and the other a video ad. A/B testing require to gauge effectiveness of both)
- Landing page implementation (our website is a WordPress website)
- Automated lead nurturing sequences
- Performance tracking and reporting systems

The goal is to create a seamless user experience from ad interaction to guide download, while capturing valuable lead data and establishing automated follow-up processes. This system will serve as the foundation for our digital lead generation strategy, with all creative work already completed and ready for implementation.
