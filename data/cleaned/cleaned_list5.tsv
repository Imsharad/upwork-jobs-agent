3. Long-Term Vision
	•	The AI model should serve as a scalable platform for generating brand-consistent visual assets.
	•	Potential expansion to other media formats (e.g., video, 3D assets).

4. Training & Knowledge Transfer
	•	Enable an in-house designer to use and optimize the AI model independently.
	•	Provide documentation & onboarding for future improvements and scalability.

Required Expertise

I am looking for an AI/ML developer with experience in:
