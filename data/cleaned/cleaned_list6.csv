   - Capture all data types: text, links, images, videos, memes, etc.  
   - Extract nested messages (comments, sub-threads) and aggregate them into clusters.

2. **Search & Filtering**:  
   - Implement keyword search within the extracted data (e.g., company names).  
   - Build a fallback mechanism to retrieve all group data, then filter by user-defined logic to surface relevant messages only.  
   - Support advanced extraction (e.g., messages that require pressing links within the message).

   - Ensure data is structured for easy storage, retrieval, and analysis (e.g., in JSON format or a database).

4. **Clustering & Organization**:  
   - Group related messages by topic or context.  
   - Provide an interface/endpoint for retrieving these clusters.

5. **Scalability & Maintenance**:  
   - Provide clean, well-documented code.  
   - Deliver a simple method (API endpoints, scripts, or similar) to fetch and update data regularly.  
   - Ensure the solution is robust and maintainable for future updates/iterations.

**Required Skills & Experience**:  
- Proven experience building Telegram bots and/or using the Telegram API.  
- Proficiency with programming languages commonly used for bots (e.g., Python, Node.js).  
- Strong understanding of RESTful APIs and data serialization formats (JSON, XML).  
- Experience with database design and data structuring (SQL or NoSQL).  
- Familiarity with message processing, including text parsing and media handling.  
- Good communication skills and ability to document project requirements and deliverables clearly.

**Preferred Qualifications**:  
- Experience with search and indexing solutions (e.g., ElasticSearch, Lucene, or custom indexing).  
- Familiarity with NLP (Natural Language Processing) for advanced search features or clustering.  
- Knowledge of building advanced filtering/logical conditions for large datasets.  
- Understanding of security best practices, especially when handling user data and tokens.

**Project Deliverables**:  
- Telegram Bot or standalone script integrating with the Telegram API.  
- Automated data extraction from a given Telegram group with robust error handling and logging.  
- Implementation of a search/filtering mechanism to retrieve relevant messages based on keywords, users, date ranges, and other criteria.  
- Complete documentation (user guide, code documentation, setup instructions).  
- Optional (nice to have): Basic interface for data viewing and manual searches.

We are seeking an experienced developer to build SmartRenamer, a cutting-edge file renaming tool that uses AI to deliver a delightful, intuitive user experience. The tool will run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, leveraging a locally hosted language model (LLM) to handle natural language inputs and transform them into renaming rules.

The ideal candidate will have experience building cross-platform desktop applications, integrating AI/ML models, and creating efficient, scalable software solutions. This project requires a strong understanding of usability and a commitment to delivering a product that feels magical to users.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Objective:
Build a file renaming tool that simplifies file management for everyday users and professionals. The tool should allow users to rename files using natural language commands (e.g., """"Add 'Final_' to the start of all file names"""") while offering advanced capabilities like metadata-based renaming and reusable scripts.

CORE FEATURES:

Natural Language Input: Users can type commands like: """"Rename these files by date, name of publisher, and title."""" The system interprets commands using a locally running LLM (e.g., GPT4All, LLaMA) and generates renaming rules.

Preview and Confirmation: Display side-by-side previews of original and renamed files. Allow inline editing of individual file names for user control.

Metadata and Content Analysis: Extract and use metadata (e.g., EXIF data, creation dates, audio tags) for renaming files. Optionally analyze file content (e.g., titles in documents or text in images via OCR).

Saved Scripts: Automatically save and reuse renaming patterns for consistency across projects.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: The application must work seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Privacy: All processing must occur locally, with no data sent to external servers.

KEY DELIVERABLES:

A fully functional cross-platform application with a minimalist UI.
Integration of a locally running LLM for interpreting natural language commands.
Modular file type support for handling text, images, documents, audio, video, and archives.
Documentation for installation, usage, and future maintenance.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Frontend:
Framework: Electron, Flutter, or PySide6.
Clean, intuitive UI for drag-and-drop file selection, natural language input, and previews.

Backend:
Language: Python preferred (for LLM integration and file handling), but alternatives like Rust or Node.js are acceptable. 

Local file processing: Use open-source libraries for metadata extraction (e.g., PyPDF2, Pillow, mutagen).

AI Integration: Use a locally hosted LLM (e.g., GPT4All, LLaMA). The LLM should generate regex/rule-based scripts from user inputs.

Performance: Must handle renaming 1,000+ files in seconds with a clear preview of changes.
Optimize for low-resource systems (minimum 8GB RAM).

Security: Ensure all file data stays local. No external API calls for file processing or AI inference.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:
Experience developing cross-platform desktop applications.
Familiarity with AI/ML model integration, especially LLMs.
Strong understanding of file systems, metadata, and batch processing.
A track record of creating intuitive, user-friendly software.","4 hours ago",0,"Intermediate","Est. Budget:",0,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Windows App Development']",26.68
