Time:	not_sure	"Job Overview  

I am a producer at a Los Angeles-based production company specializing in cinematic commercials for brands, distributed across social media and traditional platforms. We are expanding by creating a new division, which will focus on producing immersive video content for emerging platforms.  

Beyond content production, we are also exploring the potential of becoming ad buyers in this space‚Äîconnecting brands to new platforms that showcase immersive content. Since immersive advertising infrastructure is still developing, we want to position ourselves at the forefront of this shift. To support this effort, we need market research and analysis on the immersive media landscape to inform our strategy and business plan.  

Currently, there are limited spaces to consume immersive content. While often used interchangeably with VR/AR/XR, immersive video is distinct. Apple and Blackmagic have developed a camera that mimics binocular vision, creating a heightened sense of depth and realism. This differs from traditional filmmaking and could redefine advertising in digital spaces.  

The Apple Vision Pro is designed specifically for immersive video, offering the highest-quality viewing experience. However, adoption is currently limited due to its high price point. In contrast, Meta Quest is primarily designed for interactive VR experiences but can also display immersive video‚Äîalbeit at a lower quality. While most consumers are currently focused on VR/AR applications, we believe that as more immersive films and commercials enter the market, demand for high-quality immersive advertising will grow.  

We want to be the go-to production company for immersive commercials and one of the first ad buyers in this space. Our early hypothesis is that our first clients will be tech companies with an audience that overlaps with early adopters of devices like Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest‚Äîpeople who embrace emerging technology and see themselves as foreward thinkers.  

To support our growth, we are looking for an experienced Market Research Analyst to gather, analyze, and synthesize industry data into actionable insights.  

The selected freelancer will be responsible for:  

1. Market Data Collection  
 VR/AR Platform Adoption:  
  - Number of Apple Vision Pro & Meta Quest users (current and projected growth).  
  - User demographics, engagement trends, and purchasing behaviors.  
VR/AR Advertising Trends:  
  - What brands are currently advertising on immersive platforms?  
  - What ad formats exist (e.g., interactive, 360¬∞ video, virtual billboards)?  
  - Ad performance data (ROI, effectiveness compared to traditional digital ads).  
- Immersive Content Platforms:  
  - List of websites, apps, and streaming platforms that support VR/AR advertising.  
  - Number of active users on these platforms.  
  - Case studies or examples of successful immersive advertising campaigns.  
Tech Startups in Los Angeles:  
  - How many LA-based tech startups currently exist?  
  - What industries are they in?  
  - Which ones might benefit from immersive advertising?  


2. Data Synthesis & Reporting  
We need all research to be compiled into an organized and actionable format, including:  
- A detailed report summarizing findings, including key takeaways and trends.  
- Data tables & spreadsheets listing platforms, ad rates, and usage statistics where applicable.  
- Charts and graphs to visualize key insights.  
- A final executive summary with recommended next steps for our business.  

Ideal Candidate  
- Experience in market research, business intelligence, or advertising analytics.  
- Ability to find hard-to-source data and verify accuracy.  
- Strong data organization and visualization skills.

Current Setup:
A 3-step conversion funnel with the following steps: Homepage View (step 1), Contact Page View (step 2), Form Submission (step 3). 

This is presented in a pivot table, showing the 'Total Users' per step, broken down by User Medium/Source. See a screenshot of the pivot table here: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/662907a1e8243de9c315bd2e/679a888a7ced4573d58773f4_Scherm¬≠afbeelding%202025-01-29%20om%2020.56.22.jpg

The Problem:
I need to show two metrics for each step in my conversion funnel:
- Total Users (working correctly)
- Conversion Rate from Previous Step (currently incorrect)

The conversion rate should show what percentage of users continued from the previous step. Currently, it's calculating against all users instead. For example, looking at Medium ""(none)"":
- Step 1 (Homepage): Shows 38.3%, should be 100%
- Step 2 (Contact): Shows 4.6%, should be 11.9% (52/436)
- Step 3 (Form): Shows 0.5%, should be 11.5% (6/52)

Deliverable:
Create a Loom video showing how to set up correct step-by-step conversion percentages. The video should allow me to replicate your solution exactly.

Project Overview
This is a concept project intended to demonstrate a creative application of AI. We are working with an open budget, as the primary goal of our client is to understand the cost structure and technical requirements to execute this system. The system will be designed to provide users with a fully personalized music experience through three primary stages:

1. Image analysis (a photo of a hair strand).
2. Generation of music lyrics.
3. Creation of audio tracks based on the generated lyrics.

The system should work via a user-facing interface (either on a website or integrated into WhatsApp), where users can upload/send their photo for processing.

---
Examples of output attachment.

System Workflow

Below is a breakdown of the project phases and the intended use of AI for each step:

1. Image Analysis (Phase 1):
    - The user submits a photo of a hair strand.
    - This photo is analyzed by an AI model (e.g., ChatGPT with vision capabilities) to generate a descriptive text prompt.
    - The prompt logic (what to analyze in the photo) will be predefined by our team. For example:
        - Texture, color, patterns in the hair.
        - Potential symbolic or creative interpretations of the image.
2. Lyrics Generation (Phase 2):
    - The text prompt generated in Phase 1 will then be processed through an AI like ChatGPT or Claude to create custom song lyrics based on the image characteristics.
    - The logic and tone of the lyrics will also be predefined by a prompt created by our team.
3. Audio Creation (Phase 3):
    - The lyrics generated in Phase 2 will then be transformed into music using Suno or a similar AI-based music generation tool.
    - Challenges:
        - Suno does not currently have an official API.
        - We found a potential workaround (e.g., this [Suno API implementation](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api)) but need your expertise to assess its feasibility and reliability.
    - We also need to explore alternative AI music generators if the Suno integration proves unviable. Udio also doesn't have it's own API.

---
Delivery Platform
- For this briefing, we need the system itself that could be connected to either:
    1. A WhatsApp chatbot, where users send their photo and receive the generated music back.
    2. A web platform, where users upload their photo and interact with the system.

---
Open Questions
1. Cost-Per-Use: Are there costs associated with using certain AI tools, particularly for image recognition, text generation, or music generation (e.g., API calls, user volume)? Ideally you would only deliver the system and we would use our own API.
2. Scalability: How scalable would this system be if usage increased significantly (e.g., thousands of users daily)? Specially because of the Suno limitations.
3. System Architecture: What would the technical architecture look like to combine image processing, text generation, and music creation in a seamless workflow?
4. Development Time: What is the estimated time to develop and test the system?

---
Your Role
We are seeking your input on:
1. Viability: Whether this system can be realistically developed and how the challenges in Phase 3 (music generation) can be addressed.
2. Budget Estimation: A rough estimate of the development cost, including the costs of tools, APIs, and third-party services.
3. Technical Recommendations: Insights on the best technologies, frameworks, and platforms for building this system.
4. Next Steps: A proposed development process and timeline for a concept project like this.

---
Additional Notes
- This is a concept project and flexibility is key. We‚Äôre open to iterative development and testing to determine the best solutions for each phase.
- If you need more context or further technical details, we‚Äôre happy to provide them.

First project.	Save job Long Term Developer for AI Voice Solutions. First project.	Hourly	Intermediate	Est. Time:	30+ hrs/week	"Introduction & Long Term Partnership Intent

We‚Äôre looking for a skilled developer who can develop AI voice agents. The first project will be based on the conversational AI agent solution Millis.ai (similar to Vapi, but better voice AI), HeyGen streaming API-avatar SDK integration, Make.com and Airtable. See attached solution overview file Project1.

Beyond this project, we will develop multiple AI Voice solutions for clients, so we hope to establish an ongoing relationship with the right freelancer. We value collaborative problem-solving, clear communication, and a passion for cutting-edge AI technology.

The second project will be development of a web app SaaS product, based on Millis.ai for conversational voice AI capabilities, the SaaS boilerplate MakerKit and Supabase/PostgreSQL. See attached solution overview file Project2. Development requirements for this solution will be shared in a later stage.  

 

Project 1 Overview

We need a developer experienced with low-code tools (Make.com), AI voice platforms (e.g. Millis, Vapi, Voiceflow or similar), and API integrations to build a two-step AI call solution for a sales funnel:

Voice Discovery Call: A user-initiated call on a web page, using Millis for STT/TTS, knowledge base and conversation memory.
Basic Sales Call: Enhanced with a HeyGen streaming video avatar, again powered by Millis‚Äôs real-time AI conversation.
Additionally, we want to scrape user-provided websites and store a business summary in, Airtable for contextual meta data for upload to Millis.ai on start of the calls.

 

Tools & Technologies

Make.com: Orchestration layer for triggering web scraping, pushing metadata to Millis.ai, and updating Airtable post-call.
Millis.ai: Provides STT, TTS, short and long term conversation memory, knowledge base and manage multiple GPT-4.0‚Äìstyle prompts for the real-time calls.
HeyGen interactive avatar: Integrates with Millis.ai for a streaming avatar in the second sales call.
Airtable: Stores customer records, web-scraped summaries, and final transcripts.
 

Key Responsibilities

Voice call (Step 1: Audio Discovery Call)
Ensure the user can start a voice call with Millis, which provides STT, TTS, and GPT-4‚Äìstyle conversation logic.
Manage session metadata (website summary) so Millis has context at call start.
Millis docs: https://docs.millis.ai/introduction
HeyGen Avatar Integration (Step 2: Video Sales Call)
Use Millis‚Äôs AI text output to drive a HeyGen streaming video avatar on a second call scenario.
Integrate Millis.ai with HeyGen streaming API-avatar SDK (https://docs.heygen.com/docs/streaming-avatar-sdk)
Ensure real-time lip-sync or video streaming with minimal latency.
Make.com Orchestration
Automate a basic web scraping (e.g., Apify or HTTP modules) to gather a short business summary.
Store the summary in Airtable, keyed to a customer record.
Push summary to Millis in start of the first call (so no real-time lookups during the call).
After the call, capture transcripts from Millis‚Äôs session webhook and update Airtable.
Airtable Data Management
Design a simple base to store website summaries, call transcripts, and user details.
Link transcripts to the correct customer record.
Testing & Documentation
Verify that both voice and avatar calls work smoothly.
Provide basic instructions for maintaining or extending the flows (e.g., editing the prompt, changing TTS voices, or updating scraping logic).
 

Proposed Solution Architecture

The attached architecture shown represents an AI Voice Sales Funnel that integrates user interaction, core functions, orchestration, and a data layer. Here's a detailed description:

User Interaction (web Page)

Step 1: The user enters contact details and a company URL through a contact form that updates a new Airtable record.
Step 2: The user interacts with an embedded AI voice call on Web page 2 during a discovery call (Prompt 1).
Step 3: The user engages with a basic sales call on Web page 3, supported by an embedded HeyGen Video Avatar by HeyGen streaming API (Prompt 2).
Core Functions

URL Scraping & Data Extraction:
Extracts company summary information from the provided URL during Step 1.
Conversational AI Agent (Millis.ai):
Handles discovery and sales calls with the following capabilities:
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts text into human-like speech.
Speech-to-Text (STT): Transcribes spoken input into text.
LLM (ChatGPT 4): Provides advanced conversation logic and domain knowledge.
Full Conversation Memory: Maintains context across multiple customer calls for seamless user interaction.
Orchestration

Uses Make.com (Workflow) to manage processes, ensuring smooth integration between core functions and the database.
Sends metadata at the start of calls and processes transcripts after the calls end.
Data Layer

Relational Database (Airtable):
Stores company metadata, extracted summaries, and call transcripts, enabling structured data management and analysis.
Flow Overview

The user begins by submitting a company URL, triggering data scraping.
Company summary metadata is stored in Airtable and passed to the AI agent before the first call.
The AI agent conducts discovery and sales calls with contextual understanding.
Workflow automation via Make.com ensures the smooth flow of data and post-call updates.
Transcripts and other call outputs are saved in the database for further use.
 

Required Skills & Experience

Low-Code Automation: Proficient in Make.com or similar for data flows and webhooks.
AI Voice Platforms: Familiarity with voice platforms, STT/TTS/memory solutions and GPT-based agents.
HeyGen (Optional but preferred): Experience connecting streaming avatars or similar real-time video APIs.
Airtable: Comfortable designing tables, linking records, handling lookups.
Web Scraping: Basic knowledge of scraping libraries or services (like Apify) for data ingestion.
Supabase, Makerkit and PostgreSQL (Nice to Have): Bonus if you have experience, as we may expand into these platforms for future projects.
 

How to Apply

Examples: Show us your past AI voice/chat or real-time streaming integrations.
Availability & Rates: Let us know your typical timeline and preferred pricing model (hourly or fixed).
Budget Range

We have a flexible project budget in the USD $500‚Äì$1,000 range, depending on the final scope and your experience.
