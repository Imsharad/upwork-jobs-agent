Time:	1 to 3 months, Less than 30 hrs/week	"I am looking for an experienced AI & Machine Learning expert to develop and implement a custom AI model that generates brand-compliant visuals based on specific design guidelines.

Important: This is not about using existing stock image generation tools. We need a custom-trained AI model that can produce images aligned with predefined brand identities.

Requirements & Challenges

1. Development of a Proprietary AI Solution
	•	Build a trainable AI model that can be fine-tuned for specific brand guidelines (colors, composition, and style).
	•	Ensure scalability, so additional brands can be added in the future.

2. Technical Requirements
	•	Custom Model Training: Fine-tuning existing generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, StyleGAN) to fit brand-specific visual styles.
	•	API Integration: The solution should be compatible with internal workflows or external platforms.
	•	Data Processing: Training the model on brand-compliant datasets (considering legal aspects).

3. Long-Term Vision
	•	The AI model should serve as a scalable platform for generating brand-consistent visual assets.
	•	Potential expansion to other media formats (e.g., video, 3D assets).

4. Training & Knowledge Transfer
	•	Enable an in-house designer to use and optimize the AI model independently.
	•	Provide documentation & onboarding for future improvements and scalability.

Required Expertise

I am looking for an AI/ML developer with experience in:
✅ Fine-tuning and training generative AI models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, StyleGAN, DALL·E).
✅ Machine Learning & Deep Learning for image generation.
✅ Implementing custom AI workflows for business applications.
✅ Developing API integrations for seamless deployment.
✅ Scaling and optimizing AI models for specific branding needs.

What I Expect
	•	Technical Implementation: Develop & train a custom AI model that generates brand-compliant images.
	•	Scalable Architecture: The solution should be expandable to support multiple brands.
	•	Onboarding & Support: Assist with internal adoption & usage.

📌 Freelancers only – no agencies!

I look forward to receiving applications with relevant references & an estimation of effort and feasibility! 🚀"	more	about "AI Model Development & Training for Brand-Compliant Image Generation"	AI Development	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1691099314254262272	AI Model Integration	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1623716863997775872	AI Model Training	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1691099315550302208	Machine Learning	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626755474440192	Deep Learning	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626730904207360	Payment verified	Rating is 0 out of 5.	$0	Germany	5 to 10
