I need two quick needs on HubSpot, some automations (including various combinations of Zapier / Apollo / ChatGPT pro API / and etc), and then probably more on an ongoing basis.

Immediate quick fixes:

1- I embed HubSpot forms in my Wordpress website, but the font size in the forms is too small. I'd like it to match the page: 

https://www.trianagroup.com/industrial-panelist-onboarding

2- LinkedIn data enrichment: 

    - When people share their LinkedIn profile, I'd like to enrich their HubSpot with content from their LinkedIn profile: job title, company, and from there I'd like to get the company's website domain URL. 

3- One of the next projects would be resume parsing: 

I collect people's resumes in a property called ""resume copy-paste"" (it's a text property where they paste their resume as an unformatted text): 

     - When I can't enrich a profile using the LinkedIn link, I'd like to extract the job title and most recent employer from the ""resume copy-paste"" field. 

    - Then, I'd like to push that information to the corresponding properties in HubSpot (when it's missing). 

     - I'd like to automate the search of the company's domain name, using just the company name and any context that can be found in the resume (if it's not found via the LinkedIn profile).

NB: I have the following tools currently: 
 * Zapier account 
 * OpenAI account with access to their API
 * Apollo.io (with a lot of credits)
 * Sales Navigator Pro
 * Phantom Buster
I'm making little use of them, so I'd like to work with someone who can help me use them more. I am also open to alternatives."	more	"about ""AI and Automations for CRM and more"""	Skip skills	Previous skills.

We’re looking for an experienced Natural Language Processing (NLP) specialist to build and enhance knowledge bases (KBs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) sourced from various data sources, including existing external KBs like YAGO, Wikidata and DBpedia, mix of documents and articles, as well as other online sources). 
   
The ideal candidate should be proficient in natural language processing (NLP) and understanding (NLU) techniques and have a proven experience in knowledge representation and knowledge graph databases. 


You will be required to integrate difference types of data to create comprehensive knowledge structures that can be utilized across various applications.


Your know-how in NLP and knowledge graph construction will be essential in turning unstructured text into neat and organized knowledge. 


If you're someone who's skilled with open-source tools and knows your way around GitHub and Docker, as well as very good with Python and have a solid grasp of how knowledge is represented and stored in graph databases, we'd love to hear from you!


Here are some components of natural language understanding (NLU) you'll be working with: 
•	Named Entity Recognition (NER): Spotting mentions of entities in text.
•	Named Entity Disambiguation (NED), aka Entity Linking (EL): Connecting entities identified by NER to their unique IDs.
•	Open Information Extraction (OpenIE): Creating structured relationships that include a subject, predicate, object, and any other details.
•	Concept Linking (CL): Similar to entity linking but for linking non-named entities (like car, chair, etc.) to existing concepts in our knowledge base.
•	Entity Salience: Scoring each entity in a text from 0 to 1 to show how important it is in the context.

I expect you to explain your solution to me so that I can redo it all by myself. That means to get the specific hardware configurations used (such as CPU, RAM GB size, cloud specifications, etc.) together with any specific development detail to be shared. 

It is also required to get the full software code that was used for the task described above, together with explanations of the code.

Budget:	$500	"Job Posting: AI Expert Needed to Build Custom Resume, Cover Letter & LinkedIn Content Workflow Automation

Overview

I’m a professional resume writer and career consultant in Australia, and I’m looking for an AI expert to help me streamline and automate my content development workflows using ChatGPT or a similar AI tool. I currently spend hours manually submitting 20 to 50+ prompts per project to generate high-quality resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn content for my clients. I already have well-developed prompts for each step of my process but need an expert to help me create custom AI workflows that will allow me to input client materials and generate structured, polished outputs without excessive manual entry.

Must have good English skills and be open to consultations to discuss requirements and options.

Project Scope

I need a custom AI-driven workflow system that allows me to:
	•	Input client materials efficiently (old resumes, job ads, consultation notes, etc.).
	•	Automate structured content generation for resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles.
	•	Ensure consistency and high quality by following my exact step-by-step methodology.
	•	Reduce time spent manually submitting prompts while keeping outputs customizable.
	•	Possibly integrate with an AI API (e.g., OpenAI API) or use a no-code tool (Zapier, Make, etc.).

What I Want Built

I need custom AI-powered workflows for:
	1.	Resume Writing Workflow
	•	Input: Old resume, job ad, career notes, client strengths, past achievements.
	•	Output: Step-by-step resume generation (executive summary, key skills, career summary, professional experience, education, IT skills, etc.).
	•	Maintain my exact formatting, phrasing, and structure preferences.
	2.	Cover Letter Writing Workflow
	•	Input: Client’s career history, target job, key strengths, previous letters.
	•	Output: AI-generated tailored, impactful cover letters aligned with the job ad.
	•	Structured for ATS compatibility with bullet points and strong closing statements.
	3.	LinkedIn Profile Content Workflow
	•	Input: Existing LinkedIn profile (if available), resume, client strengths, career goals.
	•	Output: Optimized LinkedIn content (Headline, About section, Experience, Skills, and Achievements) in my preferred tone and structure.
	4.	General Process Automation
	•	A single interface or tool where I can enter a client’s details once and generate all required documents without needing to re-enter prompts manually.
	•	Potential integration with Google Docs, Notion, or another workspace for easy editing.
	•	A way to tweak or regenerate sections as needed without starting over.

Ideal Candidate Skills & Expertise

To build this, I need a freelancer with strong experience in:
	•	AI Prompt Engineering – Ability to structure AI workflows for step-by-step content creation.
	•	ChatGPT / OpenAI API Integration – Experience building custom workflows using AI.
	•	Automation Tools (Zapier, Make, AutoGPT, or similar) – For streamlining inputs and outputs.
	•	Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Understanding how to refine AI-generated text for polished, natural-sounding content.
	•	Resume & Cover Letter Optimization – Some familiarity with ATS-optimized resumes and LinkedIn personal branding is a plus.
	•	No-Code or Low-Code Development – Comfortable using Zapier, Notion AI, Airtable, Google Sheets, or custom scripts to create an efficient AI-powered workflow.
	•	Python or JavaScript (optional) – If a more custom-coded solution is required.
	•	UI/UX for Workflow Interfaces (optional) – If building an interface for easier data input and content generation.

Deliverables
	•	A fully functional AI-driven workflow that reduces manual input and generates high-quality resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn content step by step.
	•	Documentation or a short training session on how to use the system effectively.
	•	A way to fine-tune outputs easily while keeping my structured approach intact.
	•	Bonus: If the workflow can be integrated with Google Docs, Notion, or another preferred workspace.

Budget & Timeline
	•	Budget: Open to discussion based on expertise and proposed solutions.
	•	Timeline: Ideally within 2-4 weeks, but flexible for the right approach.

We are looking for an expert in Google Ads, GoHighLevel (GHL), and offline conversion tracking to help us properly capture lead data with all necessary Google Ads parameters in GHL and then accurately upload qualified leads to Google Ads for better tracking and optimization.


The Problem:

Our GHL setup isn’t properly capturing lead data with all Google Ads parameters needed (e.g., GCLID, UTMs, and enhanced conversion data).

When uploading leads to Google Ads, we face errors because Google Ads can't label leads with past clicks, therefore we need proper tracking on Google Ads parameters

We need a seamless process to track and feed back qualified leads into Google Ads to optimize performance.


What We Need:

Ensure GHL correctly captures all necessary Google Ads tracking parameters when leads are submitted via forms.

Ensure that we have the process in place to successfully and automatically do lead uploads to Google Ads.

Implement best practices for Google Ads lead tracking, GHL integration, and conversion uploads.


Requirements:

Expertise in Google Ads conversion tracking, offline conversion uploads, and enhanced conversions for leads.

Experience with GHL and integrating Google Ads tracking parameters.

Strong understanding of Google Ads data formatting, hashing (SHA-256), and bulk lead uploads.

Ability to troubleshoot and fix tracking errors efficiently.


Deliverables:

Fully functioning lead tracking setup in GHL, ensuring all Google Ads parameters are captured.

Corrected and automatic offline conversion upload process (error-free and properly feeding Google Ads).

Documentation on how the system works and any necessary steps for our team to follow.


We believe that it should be a quick project for an expert.

Price is flexible but we were thinking about $75 for this project


How to Apply:

Start your proposal with “GHL Tracking Pro” to confirm you’ve read the full post.

Briefly explain how you’ve set up similar tracking systems before.

Share examples of successful offline conversion tracking setups you’ve implemented.

Highlight any experience with Google Ads and GHL integration.


This is a one-time project, but we’re open to ongoing collaboration for optimization. 


Looking forward to working with an expert who can solve this issue efficiently!

We are seeking a skilled Facebook tracking expert to implement more accurate tracking for our teeth whitening service.

My business is essentially a lead gen business as we run ads to book in clients for our teeth whitening service, but currently the conversions (booking) that we receive in the facebook ads manager are not lining up with the bookings that we are getting in reality.

We have a ""Thank You"" page that clients are automatically redirected to after filling in their details, and that page is being tracked by a Google Tag.

My main concern is the inaccuracies I have been noticing within my facebook ads manager. The volume of inbound leads we get is not super high, so its easy to spot when things are not lining up, for example there will be days where facebook tracks a bunch of leads, but in reality when I cross check it to my bookings (I have a ""How did you hear about us"" question) no one even came from facebook or Instagram. 

I am aware of softwares like HYROS and Triplewhale and would like to explore options to implement similar code to these softwares to gain more accurate data within the ads manager if possible

I am currently capturing the FBCLID into a simple CRM along with my clients phone numbers.

Your primary responsibility will be to analyze our existing configuration and implement necessary adjustments to ensure 100% accuracy in tracking our campaigns and user interactions. 

Please do not apply if you haven't done this exact job before as I do not want to waste any time. The ideal candidate should have a deep understanding of Facebook Pixel, conversion tracking, offline tracking and analytics tools.

The solution has three key components – website scraping, data structuring and AI-based stocks recommendations. This solution should be scalable, adaptable to different websites and social media platforms and capable of handling dynamic content. 
The scraped data should be processed into structured reports suitable for analysis by Chat-GTP to make stock trading recommendations.

General requirements:
1.	Requests should be processed through a messaging app (e.g Slack, Teams, etc.) or dedicated website
2.	Suggest optimal LLM model to considering costs, accuracy, required time
a.	Consider both on-line and downloadable models
3.	API automation in Make.com or similar platform
4.	News scraping using best in class tools (e.g. bright data or similar) to prevent IP blocking
5.	News scraping and stock recommendations should be available in Google docks

Phase 1: Website scraping
The goal of this phase is to develop a website scraping solution capable of extracting relevant data from the targeted websites. The key requirements are below:
•	Ensure that the website scraping is not blocked. Use best in class scraping solution (e.g. bright data or equivalent)
•	Scrape data from the leading news websites, subject to request (e.g. top world news, business, financial markets, science, technology, etc.)
•	Google news (including the different categories such as top, U.S., World, Business, Technology, Entertainment, Sports, Science, Health)
•	Reuters (including the different categories, such as World, Business, Martkets
•	Associated press (world, u.s., politics, business, sciene)

•	By topic (e.g. politics, technology, world news, etc.)
•	By company name 
•	Build functionality to modify time horizon (e.g. news for today, this week, this month)
•	Keep track of API requests, system performance
•	Add interface to make requests (e.g. through 

Phase 2: Data structuring
The goal of this phase is to modify the data to be usable for Chat GPT to process and analyze the data
•	Integrate same news from the different sources and remove duplicates so that each news is unique 
•	Identify the most significant events (prioritize based on impact on companies)
•	Label data by type (e.g., earnings reports, analyst ratings, stock price movements)
•	Ensure news are organized in a clear format 
o	Applicable for Chat-GPT analysis afterwards
o	Report format that can be read by user 
•	Include time stamps
•	Ensure stock symbols and company names are correctly linked
•	Ensure the reports can be accessed through google docs

Phase 3: Stock trading recommendations
The goal of this phase is to modify the data to be usable for Chat GPT to analyze the data and make trading recommendations
•	Analyze news sentiment
•	Consider all stocks publicly traded in U.S. stock exchange
•	Make buy and sell recommendations
•	Include rationale, risks
•	Suggest ways to train AI with historical data that correlates news with stock movements
•	Recommendations should be provided in Google docs

Phase 4: User interface (optional)
The goal of this phase is develop a website that can be used to commercialize the developed solution
•	Develop a website with a robust access control mechanism
•	Add simile registration (e.g. google, appleid, etc.)
•	Implement features to monitor, log, and analyze user activity
•	Enable role-based permissions and restrictions
•	Provide a user-friendly interface for administrators and users.
•	Ensure security and compliance with data protection regulations

Time:	30+ hrs/week	"We are looking for a highly entrepreneurial, execution-driven leader to build, launch, and scale a business from the ground up. This role is for someone who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys creating systems, and can operate as a mini-CEO—taking full ownership of the company’s success. If you have built businesses before, scaled startups, or been a key operator in a high-growth company, this is your opportunity to take the reins and grow a business with full ownership.

As the first hire and business architect, you will be responsible for everything from business strategy, operations, and automation to hiring, team management, and revenue generation. You will develop the go-to-market strategy, set up systems and processes, drive sales, and recruit key team members as the business scales. This is a hands-on role for a builder and executor, not just a strategist. We need someone who can get things done, iterate quickly, and turn an idea into a fully functional and revenue-generating business.

The ideal candidate has at least 3+ years of experience in entrepreneurship, startups, business operations, or growth roles. You should be resourceful, tech-savvy, and have experience leveraging automation, AI, and digital tools to optimize business workflows. A strong background in digital marketing, sales funnels, and hiring remote teams is a plus. We are looking for someone who is both strategic and hands-on—someone who can map out a plan and execute it effectively.

This role comes with significant upside potential. Compensation includes a base rate + performance-based incentives (profit-sharing, bonuses, or potential equity) for the right candidate. The role is remote and flexible, but we expect full ownership and execution at a high level.

If you’re the kind of person who treats a business as your own, thrives in fast-paced environments, and loves building things from scratch, we want to hear from you. Please review the full job description here:

This role is for a strategist, not just a media buyer. We need someone who can visualize the entire marketing workflow and make sure video is being used effectively at every stage of the funnel.

What You’ll Do:

✅ Map the full buyer journey using video – Create a workflow (Vizio equivalent) that integrates ABM, paid social, and organic content
✅ Develop a multi-touch attribution strategy – Ensure we track video engagement and influence on pipeline and revenue
✅ Optimize ad spend & retargeting – Use platforms like LinkedIn Ads, YouTube Ads, 6sense, Warmly, and Clay to drive conversions
✅ Identify gaps in our strategy – Recommend solutions (e.g., landing pages, nurture sequences) that complement our video-first approach
✅ Refine and document best practices – Develop playbooks for repeatable, scalable video distribution strategies
✅ Advise on MarTech stack – Guide tool selection and integration for better engagement tracking & analytics

Who You Are:

🎯 B2B marketing strategist with 5+ years of experience, preferably in cybersecurity or SaaS
📊 Proven track record optimizing video marketing funnels & reducing CAC
📈 Deep understanding of demand gen, ABM, and attribution models
🛠 Hands-on with MarTech tools – LinkedIn Ads, 6sense, Warmly, Clay, HubSpot, or similar
🔍 Process-driven thinker – Comfortable mapping out workflows and creating playbooks

How to Apply:

Send us:
1️⃣ Case studies showing how you’ve used video in demand gen & lead nurturing
2️⃣ Examples of workflows or marketing playbooks you’ve created
3️⃣ Your experience with LinkedIn Ads, retargeting, and ABM strategies

Time:	Less than 30 hrs/week	"We aim to build a Content CRM that will manage and streamline our entire content production pipeline, focusing on three key phases:

Idea Generation
Content Production
Social Media Posting & Feedback

The system must ensure smooth movement of content through each phase, track performance, and keep an organized Content Inventory with content history and related data, all while integrating with Slack and Google Drive.

🔹 Workflow Overview
1️⃣ Phase-Based Workflow Structure
Each piece of content follows a structured pipeline:
Phase 1: Idea Generation

Team submits new content ideas via Slack bot or directly into the system.
Kanban View: ""To-Do → In Progress → Ready for Approval""
Once an idea is approved, it automatically moves to the Content Production phase.
Phase 2: Content Production

Approved ideas appear in the To-Do list for the Content Production team.
Each idea must go through the following steps:

Briefing & Assigning → Content Creation → Editing & Review → Approval
Kanban View: ""To-Do → In Progress → Review → Done""
Once content is finalized and approved, it moves to the Social Media phase.

Phase 3: Social Media Posting & Feedback
Finalized content appears in the Marketing Team’s To-Do list.
The team posts the content on the designated social media platforms.
Kanban View: ""To Post → Posted → Feedback Needed → Done""
After posting, the team submits performance feedback (2-3 days later).

🔹 Content Inventory & Tracking
The Content Inventory is the central repository for all content. It contains:
Content ID (unique for each piece)
Google Drive Link to the content file (no internal storage needed)
Posting History: Where and when it was posted (tracked by Slack bot)
Performance Feedback: Notes from the Social Media team

🔍 Inventory Structure
Pending Orders Section: Displays all content currently in progress across different phases, showing a percentage of pipeline completion.
Filter & Navigate: Easily navigate to the relevant phase in the pipeline by clicking on the Content ID.

🔹 Automation & Slack Integration (maybe?)
Idea Submission: Team submits ideas via a Slack bot, which are automatically added to the Idea Generation phase. Content Posting Tracking:

Once content is posted, the Social Media team fills out a Slack form specifying:
Content IDs used
Where it was posted (platform & username)
The system updates the Content Inventory with posting history.

Feedback Submission: After 2-3 days, the Social Media team adds feedback on performance, which is linked back to the Content Inventory.

🔹 No-Code Platform Requirements
The no-code expert must recommend and implement tools that:
Support Kanban-based workflows for each phase
Integrate with Slack for automation & notifications
Link to Google Drive for content access
Track posting history and feedback in a centralized inventory
Enable navigation between inventory and pipeline phases

🔹 Next Steps for No-Code Expert
Review Workflow Requirements: Ensure the platform can manage multi-phase pipelines and integrate seamlessly with Slack and Google Drive.
Recommend Tools & Architecture: Provide platform suggestions with pros/cons for each based on our needs.
Develop the Content CRM: Build the system, focusing first on internal team workflows and later on the Creator Dashboard.

🚀 Goal
To create a scalable Content CRM that will streamline content production, track performance, and ensure seamless collaboration, all while minimizing development time and costs using no-code tools"	more	"about ""No Code (Airtable/Softr) Expert needed!"""

🚀 Goal: Fully automate cold calling operations using Vapi AI to handle 500 calls daily, converting cold leads into scheduled meetings with minimal human intervention.
________________________________________
1. System Architecture
Core Components
✅ Lead Database: Google Sheets (Stores business names, phone numbers, emails, call status, and scheduling details).
✅ AI Cold Calling: Vapi AI (Handles outbound calls, manages objections, and books meetings).
✅ Automation Layer: n8n (Connects all tools and automates workflow).
✅ Scheduling & Calendar Management: Google Calendar (Meetings are auto-booked when leads agree to a call).
✅ Singapore-Specific Setup: Adjustments for visibility restrictions (workaround for local call regulations).
✅ Email Follow-ups: Gmail (Automated meeting confirmations and follow-ups).
✅ Developer’s Responsibility: Ensuring seamless connectivity to minimize issues such as calls being blocked, flagged as spam, or delivery failures.
________________________________________
2. Workflow Overview (500 Calls/Day)
Step-by-Step Process
1️⃣ Lead Input & Targeting
•	Lead data (business name, phone, email) is manually or automatically added to Google Sheets.
•	Target businesses are based in Singapore.
2️⃣ Trigger AI Calls (500 Calls Daily)
•	n8n pulls 500 leads daily from Google Sheets and sends them to Vapi AI for calls.
•	Vapi AI follows pre-defined call scripts optimized for conversion.
3️⃣ Handling Scenarios in Vapi AI
•	If the lead is interested → AI books a meeting in Google Calendar.
•	If the lead has objections → AI follows a pre-programmed objection-handling script.
•	If the lead requests a callback → Vapi AI schedules a follow-up call.
•	If the lead does not answer → AI reschedules automatically for another attempt.
•	If the lead declines → Status is updated in Google Sheets, removing them from future attempts.
4️⃣ Meeting Scheduling & Confirmation
•	If a meeting is booked, n8n:
o	Updates Google Sheets (Status: ""Meeting Scheduled"").
o	Creates a Google Calendar event.
o	Sends a confirmation email via Gmail.
5️⃣ Post-Call Processing & Follow-Ups
•	Leads that do not answer are retried within 24 hours.
•	Leads who request more info are sent an automated follow-up email via Gmail.
•	Meeting confirmations are sent automatically to both parties.
________________________________________
3. Technical Parameters & API Integrations
Component	Technology	Purpose
Lead Storage	Google Sheets	Stores leads, call logs, status updates
AI Voice Agent	Vapi AI	AI-powered call execution, objection handling, scheduling
Automation	n8n	Connects Sheets, Vapi, Calendar for real-time updates
Scheduling	Google Calendar	Auto-books and tracks meetings
Follow-up Emails	Gmail	Sends automated confirmation & follow-ups
Logging & Tracking	Google Sheets	Updates lead status post-call
Anti-Spam Prevention	Developer Implementation	Minimizes call blocking & spam flags
________________________________________
4. Deployment Considerations
📌 Singapore-Specific Adjustments
🔹 Call Visibility: Many Singapore users have their numbers hidden from unknown calls. Vapi AI must optimize call retry logic for better reach.
🔹 Call Timing Optimization: Calls should be made during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM SG Time) to maximize answer rates.
🔹 Compliance & Local Regulations: Ensure Do Not Call (DNC) list compliance to avoid issues.
📌 AI Voice Agent Tuning (Vapi AI)
•	Call Script Optimization:
o	AI handles basic objections (e.g., “I’m busy,” “Not interested right now,” “Send me details”).
o	Closing strategy: AI secures the meeting before ending the call.
•	Call Volume Management:
o	Calls are spaced out to prevent spam detection.
o	AI retries unanswered calls at different times of the day.

Time:	Less than 30 hrs/week	"Please note: any proposals with spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, AI quirks, or not personalized specifically to this job post will be ignored with prejudice. 

Overview:
We are developing a suite of embedded live, dynamic Tableau-based dashboards and reports for a specific industry and for a vertically-diverse audience (from end-users to senior leadership). 

On the team, we have deep expertise with Tableau, data modelling, and project management, but we are missing someone who can bridge the gap between raw data and a compelling, intuitive user experience.

This role is someone who is part management consultant (for narrative structure), and part product/UX designer (for wireframing, visuals, and user flow). Naturally, someone with Tableau and Figma experience will be an asset, with a focus on the latter vs. the former (as existing Tableau resource will maintain ownership).

Arguably, Figma is not needed - and a consultant with extremely strong memo- and presentation-building skills could be successful as well, but our suite of dashboards and reports are numerous in number, with various workbooks and multiple tabs each - all must be coherently stitched together into a compelling story.

Key Activities:
- Work with stakeholders to understand core business questions, but those questions and any underlying assumptions should be challenged
- Create low-fidelity wireframes and user flows (Tableau dashboards and reports have deep drill-down capabilities on data and multiple levels of workbooks and tabs: all of which have to be cohesively brought together)
- Work with our Tableau Developer and Project Manager to translate wireframes into requirements and Jira-type tasks
- Establish design guidelines, colour schemes, and placement of filters/charts
- Ideally leverage a Figma-Tableau extension to load a Tableau skeleton onto Figma, wireframe and design, then send Tableau file back to Tableau developer so that Figma-established design standards are flowed through

Key Skills:
- Experience at a consulting firm or similar role where you've had to pitch narratives, distilled complex data into crisp, impactful visuals
- UI/UX or Product Design: Proficient in Figma, with strong grasp of layout design, colour theory, and user flows.
- Comfort with Tableau, enough to collaborate with existing Tableau leadership on the team
- Bonus: experience with real estate property metrics

Project input details:
- Likely 10~15 hours initially, with opportunity for continued participation"	more	"about ""Data Storytelling & UX Specialist (Tableau + Figma + Consulting Background)"""	Skip skills	Previous skills.

Budget:	$700	"I am looking for a moderately skilled developer to create a Chrome extension which allows users to easily capture screenshots, to be sent to a GPT Vision API, and another powerful LLM with vision capabilities, to analyze and provide insightful advice based what it ""sees"" on the users screenshot.

Since GPT Vision is somewhat lacking in it's capabilities, there should be a secondary (or even third, if there is a noticeable improvement) AI image interpretation API which would validate what GPT Vision sees, or disputes it. This is why a third LLM would be good, so there should usually be 2 out of 3 of them that agree on things, which should increase the accuracy of the final output.

I would like an image returned to the user if they request it, which is the same as their screenshot, but with a certain area highlighted or circled so they know exactly where to look.  This way, the user can ask something like ""Where do I click in order to submit this form"" and it would send them back their same screenshot with the ""Submit"" button circled or highlighted.  Or ""Where is the part of this code which is giving me an error?"".

If the user sees an error in the AI suggestions, there should be an ability to submit the error noticed, along with the corresponding screenshot.  This information can be used later to further train the AI to better understand these same tasks in the future.  There should also be an ability to train the AI model further on the back end so that it can learn from new pictures (screenshots) and descriptions of them.

All conversations with the bot would be saved in the extension.  Specific conversations could be easily found using a search feature.  They would ideally be able to be organized and exported as well.

The project should be user-friendly and have seamless, low latency integration with GPT and any other APIs. The user will have the ability to send screenshots to the extension by just pressing one of the ""F"" keys while the extension is open/live.  Alternatively, they can hold the same (or other) ""F"" key while selecting a square on their screen with their mouse, in order to capture a smaller, more specific area for the app to analyze it better.

It should also have another layer of OCR integrated on top of what GPT ""sees"", to validate any text picked up in the picture.

The extension should have certain websites it will not allow such as streaming services, online courses, financial/banking sites, confidential corporate (or other sensitive) material.  As a secondary safety feature, the app should pre-process all screenshots locally first to ensure any private data doesn't leave their own computer.  This would also act as another failsafe measure to restrict access to these sites from the user, so that the program doesn't violate any restrictions.

This system will be used internally by our company to consolidate and enhance data from multiple sources—ultimately providing a high-quality, unified metadata repository.

*Key Objective:*
* Develop an AI-driven metadata engine (knowledge graph, LLM/NLP workflows, data integration pipelines, etc.).
* Integrate with multiple data sources, merge and clean metadata, and expose it to our internal applications via robust APIs.

So we are going to pull in movie data (movie metadata) from multiple sources like tmdb, TheTVDB, watchmode etc.
First, you have to design a unified database schema to store these movie data from above different sources. 
This data will be cleaned up by removing duplicates and going through different kinds of cleaning processes, and finally used to build a centralized database for the company.
And the database should be connected to internal applications of the company like a calendar. For example, if there is a new movie and it is added to the database, it should be reflected in the calendar so that the user knows what movies are coming up. I think this can be done using OpenAI's function calling.
All of the above should be done through AI agents.

*So you have to be highly skilled at following areas:*
* Langchain, LangGraph, Knowledge graph, GraphRAG, OpenAI's function calling, AI agents developing
•  tmdb, TheTVDB, watchmode API
* Database schema design and data pipeline and cleaning process
* API documentation
* AWS


I am looking to find a developer who can commit full time for this project more than 6 months. Please apply now, and I will hire immediately.
