Budget:	$2,000	"JOB DESCRIPTION:

We are seeking an experienced developer to build SmartRenamer, a cutting-edge file renaming tool that uses AI to deliver a delightful, intuitive user experience. The tool will run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, leveraging a locally hosted language model (LLM) to handle natural language inputs and transform them into renaming rules.

The ideal candidate will have experience building cross-platform desktop applications, integrating AI/ML models, and creating efficient, scalable software solutions. This project requires a strong understanding of usability and a commitment to delivering a product that feels magical to users.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Objective:
Build a file renaming tool that simplifies file management for everyday users and professionals. The tool should allow users to rename files using natural language commands (e.g., ""Add 'Final_' to the start of all file names"") while offering advanced capabilities like metadata-based renaming and reusable scripts.

CORE FEATURES:

Natural Language Input: Users can type commands like: ""Rename these files by date, name of publisher, and title."" The system interprets commands using a locally running LLM (e.g., GPT4All, LLaMA) and generates renaming rules.

Preview and Confirmation: Display side-by-side previews of original and renamed files. Allow inline editing of individual file names for user control.

Metadata and Content Analysis: Extract and use metadata (e.g., EXIF data, creation dates, audio tags) for renaming files. Optionally analyze file content (e.g., titles in documents or text in images via OCR).

Saved Scripts: Automatically save and reuse renaming patterns for consistency across projects.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: The application must work seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Privacy: All processing must occur locally, with no data sent to external servers.

KEY DELIVERABLES:

A fully functional cross-platform application with a minimalist UI.
Integration of a locally running LLM for interpreting natural language commands.
Modular file type support for handling text, images, documents, audio, video, and archives.
Documentation for installation, usage, and future maintenance.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Frontend:
Framework: Electron, Flutter, or PySide6.
Clean, intuitive UI for drag-and-drop file selection, natural language input, and previews.

Backend:
Language: Python preferred (for LLM integration and file handling), but alternatives like Rust or Node.js are acceptable. 

Local file processing: Use open-source libraries for metadata extraction (e.g., PyPDF2, Pillow, mutagen).

AI Integration: Use a locally hosted LLM (e.g., GPT4All, LLaMA). The LLM should generate regex/rule-based scripts from user inputs.

Performance: Must handle renaming 1,000+ files in seconds with a clear preview of changes.
Optimize for low-resource systems (minimum 8GB RAM).

Security: Ensure all file data stays local. No external API calls for file processing or AI inference.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:
Experience developing cross-platform desktop applications.
Familiarity with AI/ML model integration, especially LLMs.
Strong understanding of file systems, metadata, and batch processing.
A track record of creating intuitive, user-friendly software."	more	"about ""Developer Needed to Build a Cross-Platform File Renaming Tool Powered by Local AI"""	Artificial Intelligence	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626716094119936	Machine Learning	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626755474440192	Natural Language Processing	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626761858170880	Windows App Development	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626795949473792											Payment verified	Rating is 5.0 out of 5.	$200+	United States	5 to 10

We’re building a general-purpose AI chatbot for lawyers that can be seamlessly implemented into any law firm’s website or business portal. The goal is to create a scalable, high-quality solution that doesn’t require restarting the project for each client. Here’s what we need:

Core Features
- Efficient Inquiry Handling:
Answer FAQs (e.g., 200+ common legal questions).
Provide instant, accurate responses to client queries.

-Automated Data Collection:
Collect client information for case evaluations (e.g., name, contact info, case details).
Support 15+ case types (e.g., car accidents, slips and falls).

-Advanced Case Evaluation:
Analyze client inputs to provide an initial case assessment.
Estimate likelihood of success and potential compensation ranges (if applicable).
Deliver a summary report or actionable insights to the client.

-Seamless Integration:
Sync data with any CRM or case management software (e.g., Clio, MyCase) via APIs.
Automatically create client profiles and case records.

-Proactive Notifications:
Send automated follow-ups and reminders (e.g., document submissions, appointments).

Key Requirements
Scalability: The chatbot must be easily customizable for different law firms without rebuilding from scratch.

Integration: Use APIs to ensure compatibility with various CRMs, practice management tools, and websites.

High-Quality AI: Leverage pre-trained models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) for natural language processing and case evaluation.

User-Friendly: Ensure the chatbot is intuitive for both clients and law firm staff.

Timeline (Flexible)
Month 1: Core development (FAQ handling, data collection, advanced case evaluation).

Month 2: Integration and testing (CRM sync, proactive notifications).

Month 3: User testing, refinement, and launch.

Outcome
A general-purpose chatbot that:
-Saves 1,000+ hours of customer support time.
-Streamlines case evaluations and provides clients with actionable insights.
-Enhances client satisfaction with immediate value and proactive engagement.
-Can be quickly customized and deployed for any law firm.

This is a crucial stage, so let’s focus on building a flexible, high-quality foundation that can scale across multiple clients. Let me know if you need further clarification or adjustments.

Thanks,
Theo, on behalf of Statusbridge"	more	"about ""AI ChatBot Development Expert Needed"""	AI Chatbot	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1623716864341708800	Chatbot Training	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1733104400605790209	Customer Service Chatbot	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1534904342283632640	Chatbot Development	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626723769696256	Artificial Intelligence	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626716094119936	Natural Language Processing	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626761858170880	Machine Learning	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626755474440192	Bot Development	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626721043398656	Python	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=996364628025274386	Payment verified	Rating is 0 out of 5.	$0	Australia	20 to 50

But here is what is happening:

1) we have 2 KAfka broker configured with zookeeper so that if one goes down, consumers and producers can still work using the other one.

2) this works ok if one node goes done and the other is active. 

3) however if both nodes go down for some mins and then they are turned on back, it doesnt work anymore and consumers and producers are not longer able to send/receive messages

4) here is a video explaining the issue:

I am an airbnb superhost with 6 luxury cabins in the smokey Mountains, and am looking to create a dynamic tool that benefits my own buisness, other hosts, our guests and local buisness.  I also rent sport utility vehicles as an add on. The goal is to create a number of digital resources that enhance guest and host experience and drive repeat buisness. 

I'm looking to build a chatbot that is superior to the current options available to hosts...

Keybfeatures will be context awareness across platforms ...i.e:  guest asks a question about a feature on airbnbs messenger, then later sends a text message...thr bot should be able to identify which guest, and reservation data.

It must communicate as a expert level superhost, and will need to follow rules pertaining to platform...i.e: Airbnb does not allow communication about external websites...

So it might need to ""read a question on airbnb, but answer on asn sms to the guest depending on the situation.

I have a massive data set, and my background is as a tier 1 sales trainer....

If my bit isn't converting upsells 2-3x higher than the next best thing...we have failed!

Also...I'm looking for multimodal/agentic.

Use cases:  voice calls for faw, and sales.

Use case automation:
Srape specific competitor data, analyze booking trends, nightly rate occupance...track ranking etc.

Automation: be able to log into airbnb/vrbo or various pms software and re arrange picture orders, modify descriptions. Possibly price...

Will also need analysis, reporting and a dashboard

If interested please link a few projects you have worked on that are relevant and an estimate for development: goal...aspa. 2-3 weeks for chat....

Would like to know your estimate of time to produce.

Each header is a graphic file of specific dimensions and is basically a background image that needs to look like ""the brand"" of a given company. For example if it were citibank a blue gradient background and some other graphic elements that are consistent with the ""citibank look"" might be appropriate. Typically when this is done by a human, they look at the web site of the company to get a sense of the ""brand style"" - colors, shapes etc, and then create a background graphic in Canva or Photoshop.  We have about 100 examples of approved headers that were created manually. The goal of this project is to train a model on vertex whereby we upload the manually created images that are already approved along with teh URLs of teh web sites for each of the companies that the headers are for.  The ultimate goal is that, once trained, if the model is asked to create a header for a new company, it will create a graphic along the lines of the ones we have created manually, by looking at the design style of the ""new"" company's web page and adapting it into a background graphic in a similar fashion to what we have been doing manually. (Ideally the model might generate 5 or 10 versions for a given company so a human can then pick which one it prefers, and of course those selections on an ongoing basis could generate additional training data)."	more	"about ""Vertex.ai Model Training for Image Generation"""	artifical intelligence	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=free_text	AI Image Generation	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1691099107328274432															Payment verified	Rating is 4.4 out of 5.	$1K+	United States	5 to 10

Budget:	$1,000	"AI Chatbot Engineer for Fintech Startup

About the Role:
We’re seeking an AI Chatbot Developer who can build and fine-tune an intelligent chatbot to help users research and track stocks.
The ideal candidate has experience with open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning to continually improve the chatbot’s performance.

You’ll be developing a conversational assistant that provides insightful stock analysis, generates automatic reports, and learns from user interactions to become smarter over time.
This position is perfect for a highly skilled AI developer eager to apply their expertise in a fintech context
If you have a passion for AI and finance, we want to hear from you!

Key Responsibilities:
- Chatbot Development: Design and implement an AI chatbot that can converse naturally with users about stock prices, financial news, and investment strategies. Ensure the bot can answer questions, recommend content, and guide users in their market research.
- LLM Fine-Tuning: Leverage open-source LLMs (such as GPT-J, LLaMA, or other transformer-based models) and fine-tune them on our financial dataset. Continuously improve the chatbot’s understanding of finance terminology and its ability to generate relevant answers.
- Reinforcement Learning: Apply reinforcement learning techniques (e.g. feedback loops or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) so the chatbot learns from user interactions. Use user feedback and outcomes to refine responses and provide more accurate assistance over time.
- Data Integration: Integrate the chatbot with our databases and APIs. This includes pulling real-time stock data, news, and user-specific information to provide up-to-date and personalized responses. The bot should cite data or analysis from reliable sources when helpful.
- Automated Reports: Enable the chatbot to generate automatic stock reports and summaries. For example, the user can ask for a daily performance summary of their portfolio or a breakdown of a company’s financials, and the bot will compile a clear report.
- Continuous Improvement: Monitor chatbot performance and analytics. Identify common user queries where the bot can improve. Update the model or training data regularly to expand the chatbot’s knowledge and accuracy in the dynamic world of finance.

Required Skills & Experience:
- Conversational AI Expertise: Proven experience developing AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants. Strong grasp of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and conversational design.
- LLM Knowledge: Hands-on experience with large language models, especially open-source ones. Ability to fine-tune models on custom data and optimize them for performance and cost (knowledge of model compression or distillation is a plus).
- Reinforcement Learning: Familiarity with reinforcement learning concepts and libraries. Experience implementing feedback-driven learning or reward models to refine AI behavior would be excellent.
- Programming & ML Stack: Proficiency in Python and frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Experience with AI libraries for NLP (Hugging Face Transformers, Rasa, spaCy, etc.). Ability to write efficient code for both training and deploying models.
- Data & APIs: Experience integrating chatbots with external data sources and APIs. Knowledge of databases (MongoDB or Redis) to fetch and store information. Bonus if you have worked with financial data APIs or platforms.
- Financial Domain (Preferred): A background in finance or investing, or at least a strong interest in the stock market. Understanding concepts like stock fundamentals, technical indicators, and market trends will help in tuning the chatbot’s expertise.
- Problem-Solving: Creative thinker who can troubleshoot AI behavior and model issues. Comfortable working remotely and communicating within a distributed team.

Why You Should Apply:
- Innovative Project: Be at the forefront of combining AI with finance. You’ll build one of the first chatbots aimed at helping users beat the market by providing intelligent insights and guidance.
- Technical Challenge: Tackle complex NLP and ML challenges, from language model fine-tuning to real-time data integration. It’s a playground for sharpening your AI skills on a unique use-case.
- Make an Impact: Your chatbot will act as a personal research assistant for potentially thousands of investors. Help people make smarter decisions with an AI you trained – a rewarding mission."	more	"about ""AI Chatbot Engineer for Fintech Startup"""	Artificial Intelligence	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626716094119936	Chatbot Development	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626723769696256	Natural Language Processing	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626761858170880	Machine Learning	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626755474440192	Artificial Neural Network	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626716102508544	Node.js	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626762999021568	TensorFlow	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626785698594816	Python	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=996364628025274386	Data Science	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626730384113664	Payment verified	Rating is 0 out of 5.	$0	United States	20 to 50

Key Responsibilities:

-Data Extraction: Retrieve and parse “paid leave” details from payroll database entries.
-User Interface: Build a simple interface (web-based or otherwise) where employees can log in, view their available leave, and submit leave requests.
-Admin Portal: Provide an admin-level dashboard (with full permissions) to approve or reject leave requests.

Requirements:

-Proven experience using AI/no-code platforms (preferably Bolt.New, but open to similar tools).
-Familiarity with Node.js or comparable technologies (advantageous but not mandatory).
-Ability to build cost-effective, quick-turnaround solutions.
-Strong communication skills in English, with a collaborative mindset to work closely with our team.

# INPUT
1. You will be given a mysql dump of the 4 tables. 

# TECH CONSIDERATIONS
1. I'm thinking you will use Langchain and SQLAgent to implement this (do let me know if I am wrong about this) 
2. I need it to be fault tolerant -- please note: This is NOT a 1-shot text-to-sql project (we tried that, it does not work)
3. Its expected that the system will self-correct if there is an error.  (so you will need to implement Plan-Execute-Refine agent) 
4. For text fields (like user_input, openai_response), its expected that we add embeddings so that we can have semantic match (I would suggest pgvector for this) 

# DELIVERABLE
1. Langchain agent for above requirements (maybe SQLAgent?) 
2. Test suite of anticipated questions users will ask.

✅ 🔹 Learning & Adaptability

Improve over time using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.
Analyze past conversations to enhance response accuracy and quality.
Allow admins to manually adjust responses when needed.
✅ 🔹 Intelligent Escalation to Human Advisors

If a patient asks a complex question, the AI must recognize it and transfer the chat naturally to a human agent.
Example of smooth transition:
❌ Bot-like: ""I don't have information on that. Please contact a representative.""
✅ Human-like AI: ""That’s a great question! To make sure you get the best information, I’ll connect you with one of our advisors who can guide you further. Just a moment… 😊""
📌 Required Skills:
🔹 AI / Chatbot Development (GPT-4, Rasa, Dialogflow, or other advanced models)

🎯 Project Goals:
✅ Deploy AI that responds naturally, effectively, and in a personalized manner.
✅ Reduce human intervention in 80%-90% of conversations.
✅ Maintain a human and professional experience for patients.
✅ Automate appointment scheduling and patient follow-ups within Kommo CRM.

📅 Timeline & Deliverables:
📌 Phase 1: Conversation analysis and AI training for natural responses.
📌 Phase 2: AI integration with Kommo CRM and messaging channels.
📌 Phase 3: Final adjustments and optimization based on real interactions.
📌 Phase 4: Continuous improvement and automated enhancements.

💰 Budget: Negotiable based on experience.
📍 Location: Remote.
📞 Language: Spanish native preferred for accuracy in responses.

Time:	Less than 30 hrs/week	"I am a software developer seeking an experienced presentation designer to create a clear, engaging presentation on AI Agentic services. The target audience consists of non-AI engineers who need the following:

1. A foundational understanding of large language models.  
2. An introduction to tokenization.  
3. A clear explanation of agents and agent orchestration.  
4. Insight into the interplay between agents, with an introduction to tools like PydanticAI and Crew.  
5. Examples of practical problems agents can solve.

Presentations in this field often fail by being either overly simplistic—lacking actionable guidance and failing to convey how these tools work—or overly complex, relying on unnecessary jargon that confuses the audience and muddles the narrative.

**What I will provide:**  
- Code snippets, research examples, tools, guidelines, and examples. The presentation should start with a broad overview, gradually introducing agentic networks, and then transition into specific implementations and tools.

**How I expect you to spend your time:**  
1. **Research and prep:** 5–10 hours compiling research.  
2. **Benchmarking discussions:** 2–3 hours of discussions to establish the narrative style, identify must-have concepts, and clarify the balance between visuals and text.  
3. **Initial design:** 8–10 hours setting up the presentation flow and creating rough visual elements.  
4. **Refined design:** 5–10 hours ensuring slides clearly convey the message through visuals rather than text alone.  
5. **Polishing:** 5–10 hours for final refinements.  

The ideal candidate will have experience communicating technical concepts to a semi-technical audience. I envision the project progressing through four milestones:

1. **Establishing a framework and flow:** Defining a narrative arc that sets up the problem, builds understanding, poses a central question, and provides a resolution.  
2. **Visual planning:** Identifying missing visual elements and exploring creative, low-fidelity ways to present concepts—moving beyond walls of text to diagrams and visual cues.  
3. **Initial build:** Crafting the presentation to meet the outlined requirements.  
4. **Refinement:** Revisiting the presentation to address any elements that fail to resonate with the audience.

The presentation should run between 15 and 30 minutes, focusing on the minimum time needed to effectively convey the key concepts. My goal is to maximize the impact within this timeframe and ensure the resource provides substantial value to the audience."	more	"about ""Create Presentation on building AI Agentic Services"""	Adobe Illustrator	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1052162208864981006	Graphic Design	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626742929276928	Microsoft PowerPoint	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626759027015680	Adobe Photoshop	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1052162208852398098	Presentation Design	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626770443911168									Payment unverified	Rating is 0 out of 5.	$0	United States	5 to 10

Save job Need to build a fastapi application that automates tasks using an LLM.	Hourly	Intermediate	Est. Time:	Less than 30 hrs/week	"Background

You have joined the operations team at DataWorks Solutions, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

Due to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.

Your assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain-English tasks, carries out the required multi-step process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre-computed expected results.

Create an API

Write an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints:

POST /run?task=task description Executes a plain-English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps including taking help from an LLM, and produce the final output.
    If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response
    If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response
    If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response
    The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases

GET /read?path=file path Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output.
    If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text
    If the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body

Phase A: Handle Operations Tasks

The DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated:

A1. Install uv if required and run the script with user.email as the only argument. This will generate data files required for the next tasks.
A2. Format the contents of /data/format.md using prettier 3.4.2, updating the file in-place
A3. The file /data/dates.txt contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to /data/dates-wednesdays.txt
A4. Sort the array of contacts in /data/contacts.json by last_name, then first_name, and write the result to /data/contacts-sorted.json
A5. Write the first line of the 10 most recent .log files in /data/logs/ to /data/logs-recent.txt, most recent first
A6. Find all Markdown .md files in /data/docs/. For each file, extract the first occurrence of each H1 a line starting with #. Create an index file /data/docs/index.json that maps each filename without the /data/docs/ prefix to its title
A7. /data/email.txt contains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender’s email address, and write just the email address to /data/email-sender.txt
A8. /data/credit-card.png contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to /data/credit-card.txt
A9. /data/comments.txt contains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to /data/comments-similar.txt, one per line
A10. The SQLite database file /data/ticket-sales.db has tickets with columns type, units, and price. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the Gold ticket type? Write the number in /data/ticket-sales-gold.txt

Developers will call the /run?task= endpoint with a task description similar but not identical to the ones listed above.

For example, Task A3 can be written in these ways - all are equivalent.

The file /data/dates.txt contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to /data/dates-wednesdays.txt
Write the number of Thursdays in /data/extracts.txt into /data/extracts-count.txt
/data/contents.log में कितने रविवार हैं? गिनो और /data/contents.dates में लिखो
/data/contents.logல எத்தனை ணாயிறு இருக்குனு கணக்கு போட்டு, அதை /data/contents.datesல எழுது

Your task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps.

Phase B: Handle Business Tasks

The DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that:

B1. Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it
B2. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it

The DataWorks business team has listed broad additional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this:

B3. Fetch data from an API and save it
B4. Clone a git repo and make a commit
B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database
B6. Extract data from scrape a website
B7. Compress or resize an image
B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file
B9. Convert Markdown to HTML
B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Your agent must handle these tasks as well.

The business team has not promised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised a bonus if you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list.

Deliverables

Create a new public GitHub repository
Add an MIT LICENSE file
Write and test your code. Call POST /run?task=... with a few tasks and check if GET /read?path=... creates the correct files.
Commit and push your code
Create a Dockerfile that builds your application
Publish your Docker image publicly to Docker Hub
Ensure that running your image via podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 automatically serves the API at http://localhost:8000/run?task=... and http://localhost:8000/read?path=...
Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository and your Docker image name

Note:

Use the AIPROXY_TOKEN environment variable. DON’T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the AIPROXY_TOKEN environment variable before running your script. Use os.environ[""AIPROXY_TOKEN""] as the token in your script.
Use your AI Proxy token. Your AI Proxy token now has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. But try and avoid that.
Stick to GPT-4o-Mini. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says “LLM”, it means GPT-4o-Mini.
Keep your prompts short and concise. Each call to /run and /read must complete within 20 seconds.

Evaluation

Here’s an example of how the evaluation script will work on Task A2.

Run podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
Call POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2. Ensure that the response is a HTTP 200.
    Note: The task may be worded differently. It may use a different prettier version. But the broad task is the same.
Call GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md and get the revised file contents.
Verify that the response was formatted using prettier 3.4.2.

Here’s how we will score the results.

Pre-requisites: Your repository MUST meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation
    Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible

For this, we are seeking an expert developer focusing on Node.js,, react/next/vue, as well as huge experience with API integrations, particularly OpenAI and Perplexity AI.

Project 2 has a few points:
1. Create our own LLM Pipelines to process inputs, and create outputs. (here we need to interface with existing models, process data, pass data between AI agents. maybe connect to our own custom AI that we train with our data. (something like notebookLM.. )
2. A basic Website with user accounts and projects and an interface to add the inputs, and save the outputs form LLM Pipeline.

We need a very basic and minimal UI, which can use default material ai, or other ones. We can use react.js, next.js etc. 

Inside this Web Application we want to work through steps to create Brand Strategy, Marketing Strategy, web copy and much more. In order to do this, we want to have pre configured questions with inputs, send these inputs to AI pipelines, and get response from the LLM Pipeline.

Time:	Hours to be determined	"**Job Description**:  
We are looking for an experienced developer to build a custom solution (Telegram Bot and/or API) that can extract and organize data from a specific Telegram group. This solution will collect messages, attachments, and metadata, then make it all easily searchable and filterable. Our end goal is to integrate the extracted data (text, links, images, videos, etc.) into a larger system where we can cluster, search, and retrieve specific pieces of information based on keywords, users, dates, and other criteria.

**Key Responsibilities**:  
1. **Data Extraction**:  
   - Fetch data from a specific Telegram group, mapping all messages by their sent date.  
   - Fetch messages from specific users.  
   - Capture all data types: text, links, images, videos, memes, etc.  
   - Extract nested messages (comments, sub-threads) and aggregate them into clusters.

2. **Search & Filtering**:  
   - Implement keyword search within the extracted data (e.g., company names).  
   - Build a fallback mechanism to retrieve all group data, then filter by user-defined logic to surface relevant messages only.  
   - Support advanced extraction (e.g., messages that require pressing links within the message).

3. **Metadata Handling**:  
   - Capture essential metadata:  
     - Media Type (images, videos, memes, etc.)  
     - Group Link & Message Link  
     - Sent Date & Last Updated (edited date)  
     - Number of media items in each message  
     - Likes, Saves, Forwards  
     - Comments, nested comments  
     - Language (if applicable)  
   - Ensure data is structured for easy storage, retrieval, and analysis (e.g., in JSON format or a database).

4. **Clustering & Organization**:  
   - Group related messages by topic or context.  
   - Provide an interface/endpoint for retrieving these clusters.

5. **Scalability & Maintenance**:  
   - Provide clean, well-documented code.  
   - Deliver a simple method (API endpoints, scripts, or similar) to fetch and update data regularly.  
   - Ensure the solution is robust and maintainable for future updates/iterations.

**Required Skills & Experience**:  
- Proven experience building Telegram bots and/or using the Telegram API.  
- Proficiency with programming languages commonly used for bots (e.g., Python, Node.js).  
- Strong understanding of RESTful APIs and data serialization formats (JSON, XML).  
- Experience with database design and data structuring (SQL or NoSQL).  
- Familiarity with message processing, including text parsing and media handling.  
- Good communication skills and ability to document project requirements and deliverables clearly.

**Preferred Qualifications**:  
- Experience with search and indexing solutions (e.g., ElasticSearch, Lucene, or custom indexing).  
- Familiarity with NLP (Natural Language Processing) for advanced search features or clustering.  
- Knowledge of building advanced filtering/logical conditions for large datasets.  
- Understanding of security best practices, especially when handling user data and tokens.

**Project Deliverables**:  
- Telegram Bot or standalone script integrating with the Telegram API.  
- Automated data extraction from a given Telegram group with robust error handling and logging.  
- Implementation of a search/filtering mechanism to retrieve relevant messages based on keywords, users, date ranges, and other criteria.  
- Complete documentation (user guide, code documentation, setup instructions).  
- Optional (nice to have): Basic interface for data viewing and manual searches.

If you have the skills and are excited to build a high-quality data extraction and organization tool, we’d love to hear from you. Please share examples of relevant projects you’ve done and outline how you would approach this project in your proposal.

---

**How to Apply**:  
- Include your relevant experience with Telegram APIs/bots.  
- Briefly describe your approach to handling large volumes of messages and ensuring efficient search functionality.  
- Provide a rough timeline and cost estimate for the project.  
- Mention any additional capabilities you can bring to enhance the solution (e.g., clustering algorithms, NLP, advanced logging).
