Budget:	$50	"Requirement: You should have experience with creating agent on phidata.com framework

I use this code from cookbook: https://github.com/phidatahq/phidata/tree/main/cookbook/memory

I need 2 modifications:

1. I want to implement the website as the knowledge base for these agents, we'll have URLs(around 1,000)

https://docs.phidata.com/knowledge/website

I tested it with 1 website, it works fine, but I need a solution that will save these 1000 urls to our database, so each user can use it as their knowledge base


2. Reducing the duration time for the agent's response.

I use all these memory creation function, because I want agent to remember things about the user.

But I am not sure if I'm overdoing it, because agent's average response time is around 11-20 seconds. ((it keeps increasing while agent adds more data to its memory)

My goal is 4-5 seconds which I achieved with other frameworks for memory-based agents.

I check the debug logs, most of the time goes to call the tools. 

I want you to check the phidata documentation to find out if these memories are all necessaries? 

In some forum I found out that, we can use the native python functions to make them run  async & every [x] message instead of the each run, so they won't be taking too much time every message.

So, all you need to do is researching the phidata documentation or ask on the discord etc, to find the answers for these questions and fix them.

My code is ready, I need optimization with these.

✔ Verify parent company details & location using Scandinavian business registries (Proff.no, Allabolag.se, Virk.dk, Asiakastieto.fi).

Our Requirements:
- Conduct a comprehensive code review to identify inefficiencies and potential memory leaks.
- Optimize the codebase for better performance, focusing on memory management and response time.
- Provide guidance or implement solutions to prevent the server from becoming unresponsive.

Budget:	$300	"Description:
I am seeking an experienced AI developer with expertise in Azure OpenAI to guide and train me in building a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) chatbot. The solution will streamline the DPIA process by augmenting users as they navigate forms, analyze existing documents, and collaborate with team members to complete assessments efficiently.

Project Overview:
The DPIA chatbot will:

Assist Users with Navigation and Drafting:

Users, led by a project manager (PM), will upload documentation (e.g., IT specs, business cases, data flow diagrams) into the platform.
The chatbot will analyze the uploaded documents and match key terms to DPIA form questions, suggesting drafts for user input.
Example: For a question like ""Who is the data processor?"" the chatbot will analyze documents and suggest the most relevant answer based on its analysis.
Dual-Bot System for Augmentation:

Central Bot: Assists users by analyzing uploaded documents, drafting DPIA sections, and guiding them through form questions.
Contextual Help Bot: Located on the side panel, this bot explains technical or legal terms and concepts in real-time by referencing the user's documents. For example, it could explain ""data processor"" and identify the most likely candidate from the user's documentation.
Collaborative, Role-Based Workflow:

Users work collaboratively with structured roles:
Admins: Set up users, configure workflows, and assign roles.
Project Manager (PM): Leads the DPIA process and works with team members.
Team Members: Includes legal, technical, and data experts who contribute to specific sections.
DPIA Team: Reviews, validates, and approves the completed form.
The platform facilitates back-and-forth collaboration, allowing PMs to ask clarifying questions directly to team members. For instance, the PM may confirm a data flow with a technical expert or consult a legal advisor on compliance.
Risk Identification and Mitigation:

Once the DPIA team reviews the draft, the chatbot identifies potential risks and suggests mitigation strategies.
These suggestions are sent back to the PM for review and further collaboration with team members, enabling iterative revisions until the form is finalized.
Workflow Management:

Admin functionality to configure roles, assign workflows, and oversee user activity.
Users navigate the DPIA workflow with chatbot assistance until completion.
Completed DPIA forms are routed to the DPIA team for final approval.
Technical Details:

Azure OpenAI Integration:
Utilize GPT-4 APIs, Query My Documents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enable document-informed suggestions and contextual assistance.
Document Analysis:
Build tools to analyze uploaded files and match key terms or insights to DPIA form questions. This ensures consistent, accurate responses throughout the process.
Backend Development:
Can be developed using .NET Core or Python, depending on expertise and suitability.
API development to integrate document analysis, AI-powered drafting, and contextual explanations.
Cloud Hosting on Microsoft Azure:
Leverage the Azure OpenAI Landing Zone Blueprint for a secure, scalable, and compliant cloud infrastructure.
Frontend Features:
User-friendly interface with a Central Bot for guidance and a Contextual Help Bot for explanations.
Workflow tools for collaborative drafting and role-based inputs."	more	"about ""Azure OpenAI Expert Needed for DPIA Chatbot Development and Training"""	Python	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=996364628025274386	Machine Learning	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626755474440192	Microsoft Azure	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626795962056704	Artificial Intelligence	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626716094119936			Payment verified	Rating is 5.0 out of 5.	$10K+	Ireland	15 to 20

Time:	Less than 30 hrs/week	"Job Overview
We are seeking a versatile Full-Stack Developer to build and optimize trader/admin dashboards and integrate advanced trading systems for our proprietary trading platform. Your work will span:

Trader & Admin Dashboards: User-facing interfaces for account management, performance tracking, and risk monitoring.

Trading Systems: Liquidity sourcing, pricing models, and slippage optimization using CEX perpetual contracts.

Trading View Integration: Advanced charting solutions for real-time financial data visualization.

You will bridge frontend development (React/React Native), backend APIs, and trading infrastructure to deliver seamless, high-performance tools for traders and administrators.

Key Responsibilities
1. Trader & Admin Dashboard Development
Build Trader Dashboards with:

Real-time account balances (cash/crypto), equity curves, P&L tracking, risk exposure metrics, and trade history.

Interactive charts (e.g., equity curves, candlestick charts) using Chart.js or Trading View.

Goal-setting modules, billing history, and notifications.

Develop Admin Dashboards with:

Firm-wide metrics (aggregate P&L, capital allocation, risk exposure).

Trader management tools (add/remove users, assign risk limits).

Custom reporting and analytics for compliance/accounting.

Use React (web) and React Native (mobile) for responsive, cross-platform interfaces.

Implement real-time updates via WebSocket/Socket.IO for live data (balances, risk alerts).

2. Trading Systems & Liquidity Integration
Source liquidity from CEX perpetual contracts to ensure transparent pricing and minimal slippage.

Design algorithms to execute notional trades without impacting live markets.

Optimize fill prices by factoring in real-time liquidity depth (e.g., handling 5 BTC market orders when only 4 BTC exist top-of-book).

Ensure trading conditions (pricing, slippage) mirror live CEX data while isolating user activity from market impact.

3. Backend & Database Integration
Build APIs (Node.js/Python) to handle:

OHLC data for charts.

Trade execution, billing history, and performance metrics.

Risk limits, notifications, and user authentication (JWT/OAuth).

Design database schemas (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) for:

Trader profiles, trades, billing records, and firm-wide metrics.

Real-time risk exposure tracking and historical analytics.

4. Collaboration & Optimization
Work with traders, risk managers, and product teams to refine dashboards and trading logic.

Optimize frontend performance for rendering large datasets (e.g., trade history tables).

Troubleshoot latency issues in real-time data pipelines.

Requirements
Technical Skills:

Frontend: React, React Native, Chart.js, Trading View library integration.

Backend: Node.js/Express, Python/Django, REST/WebSocket APIs.

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

Tools: Git, Docker, WebSocket/Socket.IO.

Trading Knowledge:

Experience with liquidity sourcing (CEX/DeFi), perpetual contracts, and slippage management.

Understanding of OHLC data, P&L calculations, and risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown).

Soft Skills:

Ability to translate trader/admin needs into functional UI/UX designs.

Strong communication for cross-team collaboration.

Preferred Qualifications
Experience with TypeScript, Redux, or CI/CD pipelines.

Knowledge of blockchain and smart contracts.

Familiarity with AWS/GCP for cloud deployment.

Application Process
Submit your resume, GitHub profile, and examples of:

Trading-related dashboards (Trader/Admin interfaces).

Trading View chart integrations or liquidity optimization projects.

Technical interview: Discuss your approach to solving challenges like:

Minimizing slippage in low-liquidity scenarios.

Rendering 10,000+ trades in a React table without lag."	more	"about ""Build Tradingview Platform and trader dashboard ( Full-Stack Developer)"""	Firebase Realtime Database	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1204836456550481920	API	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1110580482322976768	Node.js	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626762999021568	Python	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=996364628025274386	Web Application	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1110580737240190976	Payment unverified	Rating is 0 out of 5.	$0	United States	10 to 15	HTML5	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626745118703616	Database Design	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626729578807296	AngularJS	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626712877088768

We generate several thousand leads per month from various sources including google advertising, Meta/Facebook leads, Microsoft Ads, and direct website leads. The goal is to convert leads into physical tours of our community, and convert tours into sales of new homes. We use Keap (formerly Infusionsoft) as our CRM, Fix Your Funnel as a texting platform, and zapier for various integrations. We would prefer to continue using our existing technology stack, but can adjust if needed.

We are seeking a highly skilled expert in AI and marketing automation to assist in building an automated texting platform for engaging new leads and re-engaging older leads. 

For New Leads:
The goal would be for the platform to text new leads with a semi-custom introductory message within 30-90 seconds of the lead entering our system and, if the lead responds, engage in a simple, curated conversation with the ultimate goal of scheduling a phone conversation with a lifestyle consultant or physical tour. The introductory message and responses may be tailored depending on how the lead entered our system (did they download an E-Book, Schedule a Visit, Ask a Question, Request Specific Information, etc)

For existing leads:
On regular intervals, the goal would be for the platform to attempt to re-engage older leads via text during business hours.

For existing leads (who have booked tours):
When a lead has booked a tour of our community, the goal would be for the platform to send an automated text 7 days prior to the tour and 24 hour prior to the tour. In the event the lead responds, the platform would respond in a curated manner.

For all text conversations, we would want the platform to notify a live representative if the conversation is ""going off the rails"" so that a live representative can either step into the texting or make a clarifying call."	more	"about ""Build Text Marketing Automations with Responsive AI"""	AI Chatbot	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1623716864341708800	AI Content Writing	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1691099107554766848	Chatbot Development	https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626723769696256					Payment verified	Rating is 5.0 out of 5.	$4K+	United States	20 to 50

Time:	Less than 30 hrs/week	"We have a business that files claims for clients in settled class action lawsuits. 

We are looking to build an automated client acquisition funnel for our business. The client acquisition funnel will need to be built for scale deployment with 100,000+ potential clients moving through the funnel each month. Given the volume, maintaining an efficient variable cost structure associated with what tools and platforms are selected to comprise the funnel will be important (i.e. Make.com over Zapier given the cost per operation is more economical). 

The client funnel will need to be comprised of the following:

1. AI chatbot (we have a prompt that is currently working well which we prototyped through Chatbase attached) and the associated knowledge base.

-The chatbot will be deployed within the hero section of a landing page for prospective clients to interact with.

-The chatbot will need to be able to pull from an CRM/excel/googlesheet/some type of database that we have pre-populated to greet their prospective client with a custom greeting and provide the prospect with information based on the name of their business that we already have stored.

2. Chatbot educates the client, answers questions about what we do and our process, and collects required data to prepare an engagement letter for the client to sign. The requisite data is not collected through a form in the chat but extracted from the conversation so the interaction is less bot-like. 

3. Required data is stored in a CRM system (likely Husbpot) along with the text of the client chat.

4. Within the chat once the client has provided their information, an engagement letter is populated with the variables the client just provided for them to sign via electronic signature (we would like to find a cheaper solution than DocuSign given the potential volume).

5. Once the client signs a copy of the engagement letter, a copy of the executed engagement letter is emailed to them, and stored in the CRM system associated with their contact and an email is triggered to them thanking them. 

We would like to start the project immediately and hope this could be completed in 1-2 weeks. 

You will advise on the best funnel tool stack for cost, flexibility and features.

You will work independently but engage directly with me for project management, business decision making etc.

Looking forward to discussing this project with you.

We’re looking for someone with recent experience working with Facebook APIs—especially the ones for accessing groups and group posts.

We’re stuck in a bit of a catch-22:

- We can’t query the Groups API without passing the App Verification process.
- But we can’t verify an app that doesn’t do anything.
- On top of that, we can’t add test users, so it feels impossible to build something to even get verified.

- Get an app verified, or
- Work around this to query the Groups API,

We’d love your help! We’re happy to negotiate a fixed rate for the whole thing if that works better for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Time:	Less than 30 hrs/week	"We operate a digital platform and rely heavily on Meta, Google, and Reddit advertising for scaling our business.
However, we are facing major issues with event tracking, including:

❌ No app events from iOS & Android (Meta SDK not working)
❌ No server-to-server tracking via Meta Conversions API (CAPI)
❌ No Meta Pixel tracking for web events
❌ Missing integration of Google AdJust & Reddit into Google Tag Manager (GTM)

We are looking for a tracking specialist to analyze, clean up, and completely rebuild our event tracking setup to ensure all necessary events are properly sent to Meta, Google, and Reddit.

⚠️ Important:
This is a hands-on role. We need someone who can test and verify all events themselves, NOT someone who just provides instructions for our developers.

🛠 Your Responsibilities:
✅ 1️⃣ Analyze & Remove All Existing Faulty Tracking Setups

Identify & remove outdated, incorrect, or duplicate tracking implementations.
Debug Meta Pixel, SDK integrations & server-to-server events (CAPI).
✅ 2️⃣ Implement & Debug Meta SDK for iOS & Android

Install and troubleshoot the Facebook App Events SDK for iOS (Swift) & Android (Kotlin/Java).
Ensure critical events like “ActivateApp,” “Purchase,” “AddToCart,” “SignUp,” and others are properly captured.
Use Meta Events Manager → Test Events to verify that the SDK is working correctly.
✅ 3️⃣ Set Up Stape.io for Server-Side Tracking & Meta Conversions API (CAPI)

Implement server-to-server tracking using Stape.io as the server-side tracking solution for Meta.
Ensure the Meta Conversions API (CAPI) is correctly integrated, either through Stape or directly via our backend.
Verify that server-side events (PageView, Lead, Purchase, etc.) are properly received by Meta.
✅ 4️⃣ Integrate Google AdJust & Reddit Pixel into Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Set up Google AdJust in GTM to track app events for Google Ads campaigns.
Implement the Reddit Pixel in GTM to track conversions for Reddit Ads.
Ensure all event mappings are correct and firing properly.
✅ 5️⃣ Work Closely with the Advertising Team to Define Key Events

Sit down with our advertising team to define the most important conversion events.
Ensure these events are correctly set up in Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads & Reddit Ads.
✅ 6️⃣ Full Testing, Debugging & Documentation

Personally test and validate every event using:
Meta Events Manager → Test Events
Google Tag Manager → Preview & Debug Mode
Google AdJust & Reddit Debugging Tools
Provide a documented setup guide for internal reference (but do all technical work yourself).
🎯 Your Profile:
✔ Proven experience with Meta event tracking & Conversions API (CAPI)
✔ Strong expertise in iOS & Android SDK integration (Swift, Kotlin, Java)
✔ Google Tag Manager (GTM) expert with experience in Google AdJust, Meta Pixel & Reddit Ads
✔ Deep understanding of server-to-server tracking & API integrations
✔ Familiar with Aggregated Event Measurement (AEM) for iOS 14+
✔ Ability to analyze & remove old/faulty tracking implementations
✔ Independent problem solver – you MUST test and verify events yourself, not just give instructions

Because of the variance in the structure of these Purchase Orders between customers, traditional PDF data extraction is not sufficient on its own. We have done testing with a combination of OpenAI API and PyPDF data extraction and have had some success, however the accuracy is not up to our standards.

We would like an experienced Data Scientist or Developer who can design a program to accurately convert the unstructured data into a format which a computer can read (JSON for example).

This program will likely have to include a Machine Learning Model or LLM, however we are open to the use of any other technologies including third party software like Azure document intelligence if you believe it would be easier.

The data must be processed with near 100% accuracy or there would be little benefit to our company.
