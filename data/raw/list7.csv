I have a meeting with a client who wants to automate her entire online coaching business. She is a business influencer who sells coaching programs. She doesn’t yet know exactly what to automate, but she is certain that she wants to do it.

The first step would be to conduct a full audit of her business. As an influencer specializing in AI and automation, I often receive requests for automation projects. I’d like to fully commit to this field and build a skilled, motivated team to handle multiple projects of this kind, starting with this one.

However, since I’ve never automated an entire business before, I’m unsure about the exact steps to follow, especially when it comes to conducting the audit, asking the right questions, and structuring the process. I’d like to move quickly and start with this first project.

We are seeking a skilled Facebook tracking expert to implement more accurate tracking for our teeth whitening service.

My business is essentially a lead gen business as we run ads to book in clients for our teeth whitening service, but currently the conversions (booking) that we receive in the facebook ads manager are not lining up with the bookings that we are getting in reality.

We have a ""Thank You"" page that clients are automatically redirected to after filling in their details, and that page is being tracked by a Google Tag.

My main concern is the inaccuracies I have been noticing within my facebook ads manager. The volume of inbound leads we get is not super high, so its easy to spot when things are not lining up, for example there will be days where facebook tracks a bunch of leads, but in reality when I cross check it to my bookings (I have a ""How did you hear about us"" question) no one even came from facebook or Instagram. 

I am aware of softwares like HYROS and Triplewhale and would like to explore options to implement similar code to these softwares to gain more accurate data within the ads manager if possible

I am currently capturing the FBCLID into a simple CRM along with my clients phone numbers.

Your primary responsibility will be to analyze our existing configuration and implement necessary adjustments to ensure 100% accuracy in tracking our campaigns and user interactions. 

Please do not apply if you haven't done this exact job before as I do not want to waste any time. The ideal candidate should have a deep understanding of Facebook Pixel, conversion tracking, offline tracking and analytics tools.

This role is for someone who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys creating systems, and can operate as a mini-CEO—taking full ownership of the company’s success. If you have built businesses before, scaled startups, or been a key operator in a high-growth company, this is your opportunity to take the reins and grow a business with full ownership.

As the first hire and business architect, you will be responsible for everything from business strategy, operations, and automation to hiring, team management, and revenue generation. You will develop the go-to-market strategy, set up systems and processes, drive sales, and recruit key team members as the business scales. This is a hands-on role for a builder and executor, not just a strategist. We need someone who can get things done, iterate quickly, and turn an idea into a fully functional and revenue-generating business.

The ideal candidate has at least 3+ years of experience in entrepreneurship, startups, business operations, or growth roles. You should be resourceful, tech-savvy, and have experience leveraging automation, AI, and digital tools to optimize business workflows. A strong background in digital marketing, sales funnels, and hiring remote teams is a plus. We are looking for someone who is both strategic and hands-on—someone who can map out a plan and execute it effectively.

This role comes with significant upside potential. Compensation includes a base rate + performance-based incentives (profit-sharing, bonuses, or potential equity) for the right candidate. The role is remote and flexible, but we expect full ownership and execution at a high level.
